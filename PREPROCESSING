Process to generate War of the Rebellion files:

1. Text comes in the form of separate HTML pages, e.g. 001/0100 - 001/0199,
   in the following directory:

    ~/devel/war-of-the-rebellion/ehistory.osu.edu/books/official-records

2. Run process-wotr-html-downloaded on each directory:

   for x in 0*; do if [ -d "$x" ]; then ~/devel/GeoAnnotate/process-wotr-html-downloaded $x; fi done

   This generates e.g. 001.html and 001.txt.

   (Alternatively, use process-wotr-html-combined on the HTML files.)

3. Copy each *.txt file to *.txt.orig:

   for x in *.txt; do cp $x $x.orig; done

4. Go through each *.txt file, removing trailing spaces:

   perl -pi -e 's/ +$//' *.txt

5. Go through each *.txt file by hand, looking for occurrences of MAP and
   removing them, fixing up the paragraphs as necessary. (FIXME, this should
   probably be done automatically.)

6. Also in each *.txt file, delete cases where you have "Page ###" at a
   page break; mostly happens in volume 004.

7. Also check for and fix up extraneous text breaks, e.g. in volume 019, 021;
   look for "CHAP.". Text of this sort at the beginning of a page break will
   automatically be handled.

8. Other fixups:

   gr 'PAGEs ' 'pages ' *.txt
   gr 'PAGE([a-z])' 'page $1' *.txt

9. Run get-description on each HTML file:

   ~/devel/GeoAnnotate/get-description *.html

   This generates *.desc files.

   (At this point, I removed newlines from the end of each *.desc file using
   perl, and edited some of the descriptions by hand, but this entire
   step doesn't need to be repeated.)

10. Run fix-page-breaks on each *.txt file:

   ~/devel/GeoAnnotate/fix-page-breaks *.txt

   This generates *.txt.joined-pagebreak files.

11. Copy each *.txt.joined-pagebreak file to *.txt.joined-pagebreak.orig.

12. Go through and delete footnotes and extraneous R- lines in each
    *.txt.joined-pagebreak file, cleaning up the surrounding text, grepping
    as follows:

    grep 'R *-' *.joined-pagebreak |m
    grep -C 3 '[-]-----------' *.txt.joined-pagebreak |m

13. Copy each *.txt.joined-pagebreak file to
    *.txt.joined-pagebreak.remove-preface. Edit the latter files and remove
    the preface from each one, generally up to where it says "CORRESPONDENCE"
    or "REPORTS". Beware of the fact that sometimes there is a letter or a
    few letters (sometimes partial) stuck at the beginning before the preface.

14. Copy each *.txt.joined-pagebreak.remove-preface file to *.txt.joined.

15. Remove the pagebreaks as follows:

    gr '\nPAGEBREAK.*\n' '' *.txt.joined
    gr '\Z' '\n' *.txt.joined
