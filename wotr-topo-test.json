          "text": "Numbers 5. Report of Colonel De Witt C. Thomas, Ninety- THIRD Indiana Infantry.\n\nHEADQUARTERS NINETY- THIRD INDIANA INFANTRY,\nJune 16, 1864.\n\nSIR: I have the honor to make the following report of the part taken by my regiment at the battle of Brice's Cross Roads:\n\nOn the morning of the 1st of June I left Memphis with the brigade, composed of the Seventy- second Ohio, Ninety- fifth Ohio, One hundred and fourteenth Illinois, Ninety- THIRD Indiana (my regiment), and at the depot we were joined by the Ninth Minnesota, who were temporarily attached to the brigade.\n\nThere was nothing worthy of note occurred except the incessant rain and the almost utter impossibility of moving through the road, until the 10th of the month. About 11 o'clock word came to me that it was necessary for me to move up at quick time; that the cavalry had been engaged and the enemy had turned their left flank. This was about three miles from the field of battle. As soon as I received the word I ordered my men to close up and prepare their guns for action, supposing, of course, the cavalry had met a superior force and had been driven back; and I also heard that the One hundred and thirteenth Illinois had been moved forward on the double- quick, taking position which checked the enemy somewhat. When I got within one mile, and a half of the battle ground I found the cavalry in considerable confusion at a bridge, trying to reorganize. Passing on to the battle- field, I found Colonel McMillen taking charge of the infantry as it came in, and placing it in position. He told me to take the position on the right of the road leading to Guntown, which I did, he staying until I was in position. He also told me to hold the position at all hazards, which I attempted to do. When in position I threw out Company E as skirmishers in front of the line. In a few minutes we received a fire, and upon looking up I saw men advancing upon my line, dressed in our uniform and carrying the Union flag, but firing upon us as they advanced. Some of my men, upon receiving the fire, commenced firing upon them. Myself and Lieutenant- Colonel Poole, stopped the firing, supposing, of course, it was our own men, when they (the rebels) poured into my ranks a murderous fire, thinning my ranks at a fearful rate. I then gave the command to my men \"to fire. \" Then commenced one of the hardest contested battles I have ever witnessed; the enemy flanking me every few moments and my men charging their front, contesting for every foot of ground. At this time I threw Companies A and F to the right as skirmishers to protect my flank, and also threw back the right wing to change my front; Companies A and F fell back to the line, losing fearfully. here Lieutenant- Colonel Poole, Adjutant Moody, and Lieutenant Mooney and Captain Courvoisier were also badly wounded.\n\nAfter my line was formed I pressed forward again upon the enemy, drove them some considerable distance, ad was again outflanked and had to again give back, which I did by retreating and firing, changing my front as often as it was necessary to prevent my men from being surrounded. I kept retreating and fighting until I got back to the frame house in the forks of the road. Finding the enemy were following us up very close, and the battery being in danger, I moved my men forward again, and with the assistance of the Ninth Minnesota Regiment was enabled to gain the ground first occupied by me in the beginning of the engagement, and the enemy giving way, left us in comparative quiet for a short time. Getting an order to move back to the left rear, I started with my men by the right flank and met Captain Fernald, who said I was ordered to follow him, which I did. We moved by the rear of the batteries to the left, and I think in the rear of the THIRD Brigade, on a ridge running parallel with the line o the THIRD Brigade. We had not been here but a short time until we were again flanked and ordered to fall back in the rear of a fence a little under the crest of the hill. At this point we received a very heavy fire from the enemy, which we returned, killing and wounding a great many of the enemy. In this line I found a detachment of the Tenth Missouri Cavalry on my right and the Ninety- fifth Ohio on my left. Finding the enemy were coming in on our flank and rear, we were ordered by Adjutant Abel, of Colonel McMillen's staff, to fall back. We moved back in good order until we arrived at the large white house on the hill. Here I found Colonel Wilkin and the rest of the brigade, forming a line of battle on the left of the road facing the first battle- ground. Colonel McMillen rode by and requested me to ride with him a short distance. I left the command of the regiment to captain Swift, and when I returned to where I had left him he had moved off to the right, and left some ten or twenty men whom I got together, and with some of them I burned a portion of the wagon train. I then moved forward and in a short time I caught up with the regiment, which, I think, was composed of about 190 men. About this time the retreat had commenced in good earnest, the wagon train, artillery, and cavalry blocking up the road so effectually it was impossible to get infantry along it. I gave the command of the regiment to Captain Swift and went forward on the road. I arrived at Ripley about 6 o'clock on the morning of the 11th, where I found the regiment. At 7 o'clock orders came for us to take up line of march for Salem. When I got my regiment in line I was informed that you had not arrived, and we were fearful that you had been captured. I was ordered to take command of the brigade, which I proceeded to do to the best of my ability. The cavalry wee moving at a very rapid pace, and my orders were to keep my command well closed up upon the cavalry. In moving out of Ripley our rear guard of cavalry was driven in, and the enemy came dashing up to within 150 yards of my line and commenced pouring into it a very sever fire, but we kept moving off rapidly to give way for the Second and THIRD Brigades, which were in the rear. At this place the Second and THIRD Brigades were cut off, which left the First Brigade in the rear. After marching at an unusual pace for infantry, to keep closed up upon the cavalry for some six or seven miles, we came t a very bad slough for cavalry or infantry to cross. The Seventy- second Ohio being across, the Fourth Missouri, being the rear guard and being hard pressed, came dashing through my rear regiments of infantry, which let the rebels into them. They, being out of ammunition, were compelled to break to the brush. But very few of them were captured, but made their way to Collierville, but were compelled to throw away their guns and accouterments, after destroying them so they would not be any benefit to the enemy. When the Forth Missouri broke they came running through my ranks, crying \"the enemy is coming,\" which caused considerable confusion. I sent forward to the colonel of the THIRD Iowa (Colonel Noble), and told him our condition. He immediately threw out two companies of his regiment, which checked the rebel advance. In a few moments after, Lieutenant-Colonel Eaton, of the Seventy- second Ohio, came to me and told me that the most of his regiment was captured, which left me without a command, except a few stragglers whom I told to make the best of their way to the railroad and follow that down to La Fayette. After this there was nothing of importance occurred until our arrival at Collierville, where we were relieved by re- enforcements. The enemy followed us until 4 o'clock Sunday morning, firing into us at every opportunity.\n\nI have in camp about the number of men that I brought off the battle- field proper.\n\nMy killed, as far as I am able to ascertain, are 3 officers and 21 enlisted men; and wounded, 3 officers and 58 enlisted men; officers missing, 8; enlisted men missing, 165.\n\nI would beg leave to mention in connection with my report that Colonel W. L. McMillen, in command of the infantry force, was always present in time of need to encourage my men and give me the assistance necessary, and to his most efficient staff, Captain Fernald, Lieutenant and Adjutant Abel, Lieutenant Barber, and others, I shall always remain under obligations for their valuable assistance. I would also beg leave to mention in connection with my report Captain McGrayel, Captain Elliott, and Captain Swift, who rendered me most efficient service after the death of my lieutenant- colonel and adjutant in changing my lines and keeping the men in lines during the engagements and the retreat. I am also under obligations to Doctors Ford and Sackett, of my regiment, for services rendered upon the battle- field and after in caring for the wounded, &c. Lieutenant and Acting Quartermaster Quail also has my kindest regards for his efficient services as forage master for regiment and brigade. In fact, the officers and men behaved nobly, as they have always ben in the habit of doing heretofore.\n\nYours, respectfully,\n\nD. C. THOMAS,\n\nColonel, Commanding Ninety- THIRD Regiment Indiana Vols.\n\nColonel ALEXANDER WILKIN,\n\nCommanding First Brigade U. S. Forces in the Field.",

Rogers, Eighty- first Illinois Infantry.\n\nHDQRS. EIGHTY- FIRST REGIMENT Illinois VOLUNTEERS,\nSaint Charles, Ark., August 10, 1864.\n\nSIR: I have the honor to transmit to you, in compliance with your request, a report of the part taken by the Eighty- first Regiment Illinois Infantry at Guntown, Miss., June 10, 1864:\n\nA CONTINUATION OF REPORT OF Colonel F. CAMPBELL.\n\nOn taking command, by the request of my superior officer, Colonel F. Campbell, by direction of Colonel McMillen our DIVISION commander, I formed a line of [battle], throwing the line right and left of Waterhouse's battery, then in position. My command, long out of ammunition, I ordered to fix bayonets, and thus held the enemy in check for some time until my brave an energetic adjutant, James J. Fitzgerrell, succeeded in forcing an ammunition wagon from the rear of the train to within an available distance of the front. Ammunition was immediately distributed, and the fight soon became hotly contested. Here, in connection with the artillery, we maintained our position for more than two ours, a regular stand up fight, men and officers trying to vie with each other in the discharge of their duty, the enemy making charge after charge I front, only to be driven back by volleys of grape, canister, and musketry. It was here that acting major, Captain James P. Cowens, A Company, was severely wounded and obliged to retire. His gallantry and bravery cannot be too highly commended. Thus stood the brave boys of my command, with a noble band oft eh Ninety- fifth Illinois on my left, fighting back the enemy from our battery, which was managed with the most consummate skill and manned with desperate courage, until the line on my left gave way ad allowed the enemy to come in my rear; nor did the contest end until we were almost surrounded. Seeing that I should soon be cut off, and there being no superior officer near from whom to receive orders, I directed my command to fall back. We filed off slowly by the left flank, thus giving the battery men time to bring off most of their guns, which they did in the most gallant style. Thus ended the contest at the white house. My command fighting until almost surrounded, the enemy within twenty steps of our guns, we were the last to leave the field that day. I marched my men off slowly through the little valley below, keeping my command well together. We crossed a stream and reformed in line of battle, and protected the battery while crossing. We again fell back to the crest of the next hill, about one mile distant, subject all the time to a terrific cannonading from the batteries of the enemy. Here we again formed in line, in connection with other regiments, to check the advance of the foe. This position was held until dark, checking and driving back the enemy, being no cavalry to protect our flanks, I withdrew my command and continued the retreat toward the town of Ripley, which we reached after traveling all night.\n\nEarly in the morning of the 11th I reported my command in a regular organized body to my brigade commander. We had hardly stacked arms when we were again attacked by the enemy on three sides [of] the town. I was again called into line to repulse the enemy. My men having but a chance cartridge, and there being no chance of filling our depleted cartridge- boxes, I ordered my men into line, fixed bayonets, and charged forward. The enemy did not wait to receive us but fled, when by orders from General Grierson I endeavored to make the road which led WEST from the town on which the command had gone out. Moving by the flank at double- quick, firing the remainder of our ammunition as we went to keep them in check, who were making every effort to cut us off, we at last reached the woods, with the loss of a few men wounded or cut off in the retreat. When I arrived at the road I found that I was in the rear of a body of cavalry and infantry. We traveled on at a rapid pace some twelve or fifteen miles from Ripley, the enemy constantly harassing our rear, when the cavalry gave way and allowed the enemy to make a dash on the rear of our column. The infantry being thus left unprotected, with no ammunition, exhausted with more than twenty- four hours' constant exertion without rest or food, many of them became an easy prey to the enemy. From this time it became impossible to preserve an efficient organization. We marched the remainder of the day and night an until 9 a. m. of the 12th, when we arrived at Collierville, twenty- five miles from Memphis, on line of railroad, after FIFTY hours of constant marching and fighting without rest or food, and a loss of 141 killed, wounded, and missing, out of all told of 371 with us on the morning of the 10th of June.\n\nIn closing this report I must say that I have never seen men fight with more desperate courage or obstinate tenacity than did men on this field. I can bear witness to the courage of the Ninety- fifth Illinois Volunteers and Waterhouse's battery, which were under my immediate view and fought side by side with us during the engagement. To notice individual instances of courage in my command would perhaps be making invidious distinction; I cannot, however, speak too highly of the conduct of both officers and men under my command during the action and in the retreat; many of them have ever won places of grateful remembrance in the hearts of their brother officers and soldiers by deeds of daring an kindness which can never be forgotten.\n\nI have the honor to subscribe myself, your most obedient servant,\n\nA. W. ROGERS,\n\nLieutenant- Colonel Eighty- first Illinois Volunteer Infantry.",

Rawolle, to visit you in person, in order that you may receive a true version of the circumstances which led to the failure of my expediting. I regret that I have not yet been able to complete my official report and furnish you with a copy. I am exceedingly anxious that you receive the newspaper slanders for what they are worth, and make up your mind as to my part o this unfortunate affair only after hearing the truth. On returning to Memphis I asked General Washburn to relieve me from active duty for the present. He did so, and directed me to report by telegraph to the Secretary of War. This I did, but have received no reply. I also made application for a court to investigate the causes of our defeat. A court or commission has been ordered, but not at my request, and nearly all the commanders of DIVISIONS and brigades (whom I asked might be summoned) have again taken the field. The commission, I learn, will meet to- morrow, and I am retained as a witness. In short, there is no doubt but this is a simple inquisition, and I do hope you will dissolve it and order a commission of intelligent officers who will give me a hearing. I inclose copies of communications received from Colonel McMillen, who commanded the infantry, and Colonel Waring, + who commanded a brigade of cavalry. I have others and will receive still others from nearly all commanders, as they have called upon me to tender their testimony in regard to my conduct of the campaign. If your order a court I hope it will be at some other point than this, say Cincinnati or Louisville, or anywhere except here.\n\nI am, general, very respectfully,\n\nS. D.

          "text": "Moscow, Tenn., June 24, 1864.\n\nBrigadier General S. D. STURGIS, U. S. Volunteers:\n\nGENERAL: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of the 22nd instant, requesting me to give you a statement, in writing setting forth my views of the causes of our defeat at Brice's Cross-Roads; my knowledge of your general management of the campaign; and whether or not, in my opinion, you were to blame for the failure of the expedition; and if so, to what extent. I respectfully submit the following statement:\n\nFirst, as to the causes of the defeat: In my opinion they are to be sought in the nature of the expedition you were charged with conducting. The expedition consisted of 5,000 infantry and 3,000 cavalry, with a train of more than 200 wagons, making some 4,600 animals to be subsisted. Rations for the men were transported in the wagons, but after leaving La Fayette you were entirely dependent upon the country for forage. The line of march was through a country devastated by the war, and containing little or no forage, rendering it extremely difficult, and for the greater portion of the time impossible, to maintain the animals in a serviceable condition. The roads were narrow, leading through dense forests, and over streams rendered almost impassable by the heavy rains which fell daily from the time we left Memphis until our return. The country was new to you, and I know the difficulty you constantly encountered in obtaining information concerning roads and crossings of streams. Almost every man and woman along the line of march is an enemy, eager to communicate information of our force and movements, but professing entire ignorance as to the position or number of the enemy. Laboring under all these disadvantages, you moved against an enemy who possessed long lines of railroad with which to concentrate troops and supplies at any point you might threaten. He only had to await your arrival near the railroad, and with a superior force overpower your army and drive it back with heavy loss in men and material. Either you were obliged to abandon the object of the expedition before reaching the immediate presence of the enemy, or overpower him with that portion of your army which could be spared from guarding the long line of wagons. The latter you attempted but failed in, from tveloped a heavier force than you could bring into action. The engagement itself was, so far as I know, managed as well as circumstances would permit, was fought with spirit, even desperation, and with no loss of consequence, in material or men (except the killed and wounded). You were, however, defeated and obliged to retreat over an impassable road during a dark night, and with exhausted animals and men. Under these circumstances teams and artillery were abandoned, in order to save a heavier loss in men.\n\nSecond, as to your management of the campaign: I have never known greater efforts to be made by any commanding officer to conduct a column of troops in an orderly and compact manner than were made by you. I known that you were extremely anxious that the troops should be kept well in hand, ready for any emergency, and that every precaution was taken to prevent surprise. I also know that every means was taken by you to obtain information as to the movements of the enemy and his strength; and that your efforts in this line were extremely unsatisfactory. On the day of the battle the column was as well closed up as the nature of the road over which we were moving would permit, and the troops were put into position as fast as they could come up.\n\nBefore closing, general, I desire to bear testimony to the important fact that when we reached Ripley, your judgment, and the judgment of officers high in command, would have turned you back, had it not been that your orders to proceed were positive; and for the reason that only a short time before you had conducted another expediting to near the same point, and had returned, because you considered farther progress extremely hazardous, if not impracticable. In the face of this decision you were sent through the same country, encumbered with a heavy train, without, so far as I know, discretionary powers; and you went on to meet the disaster your better judgment told you was imminent shr an enemy in foy. As to the slanderous charges with which the country is being flooded concerning you personally, they are simply false, and beneath your notice or mine.\n\nW. L. McMILLEN,\n\nColonel Ninety- fifth Ohio Infantry, Commanding.\n",

C.:\n\nI am starting for the extreme front in Buzzard Roost Gap, and write this dispatch that you may understand. Johnston acts purely on the defensive. I am attacking him on his strongest fronts, viz, west and north, till McPherson breaks his line at Resaca, when I will swing round through Snake Creek Gap, and interpose between him and Georgia. I am not driving things too fast, because I want two columns of cavalry that are rapidly coming up to me from the rear, Stoneman on my left and Garrard on my right, both due to-day. Yesterday I pressed hard to prevent Johnston detaching against McPherson, but to-day I will be more easy, as I believe McPherson has destroyed Resaca, when he is ordered to fall back to mouth of Snake Creek Gap and act against Johnston's flank when he does start. All are in good condition.\n\nW. T. SHERMAN,\n\nMajor-General.",

We hold Snake Creek to its debouch into Sugar Valley, and to force a passage by the north would separate our forces too much and push Johnston more compact; and to pass Buzzard Roost would be to enter the very trap prepared for us. Your report of withdrawal is perfectly satisfactory, and was described to me by Captain Pe, as seen from the mountain, as very handsome. Let me hear from you on the subject of my first note, and state specifically the position of all your troops at 12 m. to-day, as you understood them, Stoneman included.\n\nYours,\n\nW. T.

LOGAN,\n\nCommanding Fifteenth Army Corps:\n\nGENERAL: We met on emerging from the gorge one brigade of cavalry (rebel), who were endeavoring to get possession of the gap. Prisoners report that one regiment, Fourth Georgia Cavalry, is coming up the Pocket road to the Furnace, and that Wheeler, with a cavalry force, is trying to cross the mountain from the north, the three forces to form a junction at the west end of the gap. We have been a little too quick for them. It is necessary, however, that the guard left with the train be vigilant and have pickets well out on all the roads. There are enough of them to whip any enemy, if they do not permit themselves to be surprised. I think that Kilpatrick will attend to any cavalry that crosses the mountain from the north.\n\nYours, truly,\n\nJAS. B. McPHERSON,\n\nMajor-General, Commanding.",

General McPherson? I make this proposition simply because I think General Hooker's corps will be sufficient to enable General McPherson to whip any force that Johnston can bring against him. Not knowing what your plans may be, I submit this for your consideration.\n\nI am, general, respectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nGEO. H. THOMAS.",

I hardly dare suggest to Ould, when he reports to me, as he will, that he cannot find them, that I can put them into his possession, because that will show such a correspondence with Richmond as will alarm them, and will redouble their vigilance to detect my of information. I am, however, under the direction of the President.\n\nBENJ. F. BUTLER,\n\nMajor-General, Commanding."

Here the column halted while a detachment from the One hundred and twenty-fifth New York Volunteers, led by Captain R. S. Seabury, assistant adjutant-general Third Brigade, was sent forward to seize the ford and force a passage, which having been accomplished, the column moved forward and effected a crossing with considerable difficulty, owing to the strong current and depth of water (which reached the waists of the men) and the steep and slippery banks. After crossing, the regiment moved forward with the brigade and took possession of an eminence about three-fourths of a mile southeast from the ford, on which were a house and out-buildings. We were ordered, in case of an attack, to occupy and hold this house and out-buildings at all hazards. About 3 p. m. the regiment was ordered to support that portion of the skirmish line held by the Thirty-ninth New York Volunteers on the left of our line. The regiment remained in position as a reserve until about 5 p. m., when the skirmishers of the enemy, having been heavily re-enforced, moved forward and commenced a rapid firing. The regiment immediately deployed and returned the fire with such effect that though the enemy outnumbered us 3 to 1 his advance was stopped, and he was held in check until night put an end to the conflict. About midnight, in obedience to orders received through Colonel Crandell, of the One hundred and twenty-fifth New York Volunteers, I withdrew the regiment and recrossed the Rapidan.\n\nThroughout the whole affair the conduct of both officers and men was such as to merit my highest approbation. Though suffering severely from cold, wet, and fatigue they performed every duty and faced danger with a zeal and courage worthy of their past reputation. Although subjected from the commencement to the end of the fight to an enfilading fire from the right and left, besides a direct fire from the front, our loss was only 1 wounded and 2 missing.\n\nI am, captain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nI. M. LUSK,\n\nLieutenant-Colonel, Commanding 111th New York Volunteers."

I detailed Captains Baer and Schwickardi to command all the old soldiers of the regiment (100 in number) as skirmishers to cross the Rapidan River, which they did in gallant style, driving the enemy from their rifle-pits and capturing 15 prisoners. The regiment was the second to form line on the opposite side of the river. It marched in line of battle to within gunshot of the enemy's skirmishers. About 12 m. I changed front to the right and took position on the Morton's Ford road. About 5 p. m. I was ordered to form line of battle to the right of General Hays' headquarters, under a heavy fire of the enemy, which was done very promptly considering that the men under my command were never under fire before and not two months in service.\n\nMy loss was 1 enlisted man killed, 17 wounded, and 17 missing. Lieutenant L. Derndinger was severely wounded in the left arm while on the skirmish line.\n\nI take pleasure in making honorable mention of First Lieutenant John McE. Hyde, acting adjutant of the regiment, who rendered me excellent service on the field; also Captains Baer and Schwickardi and Lieutenant Derndinger, for gallantry; also Chief Bugler Anton Rang, for bravery on the skirmish line. I recrossed the Rapidan at 1 a. m. next day.\n\nI have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nJAMES G. HUGHES,\n\nLieutenant Colonel, Commanding Thirty-ninth New York Volunteers."

          "text": "Numbers 2. Report of Lieutenant George W. Yates, aide-de-camp to Major-General Pleasonton, U. S. Army.\n\nHEADQUARTERS CAVALRY CORPS, March 3, 1864.\n\nGENERAL: I have the honor to report that I joined an expedition, composed of 1,500 men and one section of artillery, commanded by Lieutenant Porter, Battery E, First Artillery, the whole commanded by Brigadier General George A. Custer, on the night of the 28th of February, 1864, at Madison Court-House, Va.\n\nOn the 29th, at 1 a. m., reveille was sounded, and \"to horse\" at 2 a. m. We immediately thereafter took up our line of march in the direction of the Rapidan River, traveling in a southwesterly direction. Approaching Wolftown we met a small cavalry picket, which fled at our approach. At daylight we struck the Rapidan River at its south fork, crossing at Banks' Mill Ford without opposition, and pushing forward in the direction of Stanardsville, at which place we arrived in the direction of Orange Court-House. Passing through Stanardsville we kept a course south by west in the direction of Charlottesville, arriving at the Rivanna River about 3 p. m., crossing its south fork at Naked Run on a large bridge. Here we heard the locomotives of four different trains of cars approaching Charlottesville from the direction of Gordonsville and Orange Court-House.\n\nAbout 1 1\\2 miles from the river we met the enemy's cavalry pickets, which were driven in toward Charlottesville. We soon, however, met a stout force of cavalry, the enemy having mean time opened fire from three pieces of artillery. We ascertained from prisoners and citizens captured that the enemy were pretty strong, having one battalion of artillery (twenty pieces), one brigade of cavalry. The infantry had evidently just arrived by the trains above mentioned, and I am satisfied by the reports of prisoners that there was no infantry at Charlottesville an hour before our arriving at Rivanna River.\n\nCaptain Ash, of the Fifth U. S. Cavalry, with 65 men, was sent to the left in the direction of the enemy's guns to reconnoiter. He charge the enemy's artillery camp, driving them back, and succeeded in capturing 6 caissons and 2 artillery forges, which he destroyed. He then burned their camp and camp equipage, &c. Heavy columns of infantry then appearing, Captain Ash was recalled. He joined the command, having met with no loss, 1 man being slightly wounded. We then recrossed the river, burned the bridge, and also destroyed a large flour mill near the bridge. During the day we had captured 500 horses from citizens and the enemy. We found abundance of forage and provisions through the country which we had traveled. At 9 p. m. the command was halted for the purpose of feeding and resting the horses about 8 miles southwest of Stanardsville. About that time a heavy rain set in. The night was intensely dark. After resting about an hour and as half, General Custer issued orders to proceed to Stanardsville. Colonel Stedman, with 500 men, led the advance. During the darkness his command became separated from the main column and we lost our road. A halt was ordered. An aide was sent forward to halt Colonel Stedman's command, but the aide also lost the road and could not find him. Colonel Stedman in the mean time was on the right road and pushing\n\nrapidly forward toward Stanardsville. Several parties were sent out to intercept moved forward again on the right road to Stanardsville. On our arrival there we learned that Colonel Stedman passed through the town at midnight, taking the road to Bank's Mill Ford.\n\nAbout 2 miles from Stanardsville the advance guard, under the command of Captain Ash, Fifth Cavalry, came up with a rear guard of the enemy's cavalry who were following the rear of Colonel Stedman's command. As soon as they discovered our approach they charged our advance, supposing we were a small party which had been scouting and left in rear of Colonel Stedman's command. The enemy showed quite a large body of cavalry, charged our advance, drove them in rapidly to the main body. Mean time General Custer had massed his forces in a ravine out of sight of the enemy. Captain Ash fell back as far as the head of the ravine just mentioned, the enemy at the same time pouring out of the woods in large numbers. General Custer having made adequate preparations ordered a charge of his entire force. Officers and men moved forward in magnificent style, charging desperately upon the enemy, driving them back in confusion. We captured about half a dozen prisoners, and learned from them that we were fighting General Stuart with two brigades of cavalry, one brigade commanded by General Porter, commanding the section, immediately opened fire on the enemy with shell, and they immediately withdrew. The enemy had no artillery. We pressed them rapidly for about 2 miles, when we learned that we were on the wrong road; the road we were on led to Burton's Ford on the Rapidan, where the enemy had a force of infantry. I would here state that at the point from whence we made the charge the road forked, the one to the right running about due north to Burton's Ford, the one which the enemy had retreated on, while the other to the left running northeast direct to Banks' Mill Ford, the one we should have taken at the forks. General Custer, as soon as he ascertained this circumstance, ordered his command back to take the Bank's Mill road. The enemy followed our rear, but showed no disposition to renew the attack. We destroyed another large mill, containing flour, about 2 miles before reaching Bank's Mill Ford. We crossed the ford without further molestation and proceeded toward Madison Court-House. At the ford we destroyed Bank's Mill, containing flour and corn-meal. About 5 miles from Madison Court-House we met Colonel Stedman's command of 500 men, they having arrived at Wolftown about daylight that morning; having heard our guns about 11 a. m., the colonel moved his command in the direction of Burton's Ford, where he saw the cavalry and infantry above mentioned. Colonel Stedman had a slight skirmish with the enemy on the north side of the river near Burton's Ford, but withdrew his command and proceeded in the direction of Madison Court-House, where we overtook him.\n\nThe whole command arrived at Madison Court-House before dark on the evening of the 1st of March, having captured 500 horses, between 50 and 60 prisoners (most, however, being citizens).\n\nWe met with no loss with the exception of half a dozen men slightly wounded, and they rode their horse into Madison Court-House. We knew of 3 of the enemy who were killed, and several wounded, the enemy having left them on the field.\n\nI am under the impression that if we had a brigade of infantry in light marching order, between Bank's Mill Ford and Stanardsville, we could have captured the enemy's force sent out to intercept us. All inquiries failed to elicit any information as to the whereabouts of General Kilpatrick. I am satisfied that the forces we met knew nothing of his movements.\n\nI left the command at Madison Court-House about 8 o'clock in the evening and arrived at these headquarters at 2 a. m. on the morning of the 2nd.\n\nI am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nGEO. W. YATES,\n\nFirst Lieutenant and Aide-de-Camp."

Mosby, Forty-third Virginia Cavalry Battalion.\n\nFEBRUARY 21, 1864.\n\nMAJOR: I have the honor to report that about 8 o'clock yesterday morning, on being informed that a large body of the enemy's cavalry were in Upperville, I took immediate steps to be prepared to meet them. The enemy proceeded some distance along the pike toward Piedmont, when they started back. I did all in my power to retard my men time to collect. After getting between 50 and 60 together i attacked them about 12 miles beyond Upperville. A sharp skirmish ensued, in which we repulsed them in three distinct charges and drove their sharpshooters from a very strong position behind a stone wall. They fled in the direction of Harper's Ferry. We pursued them about 2 miles. They were enabled to cover their retreat by means of their numerous carbineers posted behind stone fences. As my men had nothing but pistols, with only a few exceptions, I was compelled to make flank movements in order to dislodge them, which, of course, checked a vigorous pursuit. Citizens who counted the enemy inform me that they numbered 250 men, under command of Major Cole. They left 6 of their dead on the field, among them 1 captain, 1 lieutenant, and 7 men prisoners; also, horses, army equipments, &c. The road over which they retreated was strewn with abandoned hats, haversacks, &c. They left 6 of their dead on the field, among them 1 captain, 1 lieutenant, and 7 men prisoners; also, horses, army equipments, &c. The road over which they retreated was strewn with abandoned hats, haversacks, 7c. They impressed wagons to carry off their wounded.\n\nWhile all acted well, with but few exceptions, it is a source of great pride to bring to your notice the names of some whose conspicuous gallantry renders their mention both a duty and a pleasure. They are Captain and Lieutenant Chapman, Lieutenants Fox, Richards, Sergeants Palmer, Lavender, and Privates Munson, Edmons, Montjoy, Starke, and Cunningham. My loss was 2 wounded.\n\nRespectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nJNO. S. MOSBY,\n\nLieutenant-Colonel, Commanding."

          "text": "Major-General BUTLER.\n\nHEADQUARTERS U. S. FORCES,\nYorktown, February 9, 1864.\n\nMAJOR: I have the honor to report the following operations of the forces under my command, undertaken with a view to the surprise and capture of Richmond, and incidental results:\n\nAll the infantry and cavalry placed at my disposal by the general commanding, being about 4,000 of the former and 2,200 of the latter, was suddenly concentrated behind my lines at Williamsburg after dark on the evening of the 5th instant, together with Hunt's and Belger's light batteries.\n\nThe infantry, consisting of three white regiments, brigade under Colonel R. M. West, First Pennsylvania Light Artillery, and three colored regiments under Colonel Duncan, Fourth U. S. Colored Troops, moved thence at 9 a. m. on the 6th, carrying on the person six days' rations in the knapsack and 70 rounds of cartridges - 40 in the boxes and 30 in the knapsack.\n\nThe cavalry, being detachments of five regiments under Colonel S. P. Spear, Eleventh Pennsylvania Cavalry, moved two hours later. Colonel Spear was directed to arrive at Bottom's Bridge, 12 miles this side of Richmond, by 3 a. m. of the 7th, surprise it, and move on rapidly to Richmond. A picked company under Captain Hill, First New York Mounted Rifles, with selected horses, was placed in advance to ride down the three pickets - at New Kent, Baltimore Cross-Roads, and at the bridge. Arrangements had been previously made to have the telegraph wire between Meadow Station and Richmond cut between dark and midnight of the 6th. By these means it was hoped to surprise the enemy's Battery Numbers 2, on the Bottom's Bridge road near Richmond, and occupy Capital Square in that city for at least two or three hours; detachments previously detailed and carefully instructed breaking successively from the main column, on entering, for various specific purposes. Of course the success of the enterprise was based upon the sudden and noiseless surprise of the strong picket at Bottom's Bridge, without which it would be impossible for cavalry alone to pass Battery Nol. 2. Colonel Spear failed to capture the pickets at Baltimore Cross-Roads, owing to the excessive darkness of the night, which unfortunately proved to be cloudy and rainy. He reached Bottom's Bridge, a distance of 51 miles, ten minutes before the time designated, but found the enemy there in strong force, with infantry, cavalry, and artillery. They had received notice some sixteen hours previously, as appeared from the testimony of various persons in the vicinity, including women, children, and negroes, separately examined, of the arrival near Williamsburg of accessions to our usual force, and had during that time been vigorously making preparations. The bridge planks had been taken up, the fords both above and below effectually obstructed, extensive earth-works and rifle-pits constructed, and a strong force of troops brought down by the York River Railroad, by which large accessions were still arriving.\n\nThe darkness prevented an attack till morning, when a detachment of the New York Mounted Rifles, under Major Wheelan, made a gallant but unsuccessful charge on the bridge by the only approach - a long causeway flanked on either hand by an impassable marsh. The enemy opened with canister, first checking and then repulsing the charge, with a loss to us of 9 killed and wounded and 10 horses killed. All our men were subsequently brought off, as well as the saddles and equipments. The river was reconnoitered both above and below for some miles, but at every possible crossing the enemy was found in force with newly placed obstructions. Three regiments of infantry were plainly seen, besides other infantry, which fired from the woods, where their numbers could not be ascertained. Four batteries of field artillery were counted, and at least one heavy gun was in position, its shot reaching the bluff on this side and falling far in our rear.\n\nOur infantry had marched on the 6th 33 miles, arriving at New Kent Court-House at 2 a. m. on the 7th. After a halt of three hours I moved on with them rapidly as possible toward the firing at the bridge, which was plainly audible. At 11 a. m., knowing from the continued firing ahead that Colonel Spear had not succeeded in effecting a passage, and that even if now effected our object of surprising the city must necessarily be defeated, I sent him orders to retire, but kept pushing on to his support lest his condition might be worse than I supposed. The infantry had arrived within 7 miles of the bridge when it met the head of his returning column, and after hearing from him the full state of the case, I reluctantly felt obliged to retire my whole force, not feeling authorized to incur the loss necessary to force the position without any longer an ulterior object to justify it. The cavalry was suffered to pass ahead, except about 300 men of the Third New York Cavalry, under Lieutenant-Colonel Lewis, retained for rear guard.\n\nAt Baltimore Store the enemy overtook and attacked my rear\n\nguard with vigor, but were quickly and handsomely repulsed by it, with the aid of a section of Belger's battery, the two pieces being alternately fired and retired to new positions. The enemy in this affair lost at least one officer and some few men, whom they abandoned till we had passed on.\n\nThe command bivouacked at New Kent unmolested, and on the 8th, the cavalry being out of forage, which the country did not afford, were sent ahead, arriving at Williamsburg the same evening. The infantry bivouacked in order of battle at Burnt Ordinary, and to-day returned to their former camp, having marched during the four days of their absence 33, 28, 18, and 25 miles, respectively, with alacrity and cheerfulness, and almost without straggling, the colored troops being in this respect, as usual, remarkable. With the exception of a little looseness of discipline in one or two of the cavalry regiments in returning, the conduct of officers and men, both in action and on the march, was everything that could be desired.\n\nThe whole result of the expedition, in addition to one or two prisoners captured and a few refugees, escaped Union prisoners, and negroes picked up and brought in, is the obvious fact that a small force in this vicinity, actively handled, can and should hold a much superior force of the enemy in the immediate vicinity of Richmond inactive except for its defense.\n\nI have the honor to be, major, with great respect, your obedient servant,\n\nISAAC J. WISTAR,\n\nBrigadier-General, Commanding."

C., February 23, 1864.\n\nMAJOR: I have the honor to report that General Wessells, commanding Sub-district of the Albermarle, dispatched the army gunboat Foster on the 16th to the Alligator River upon a reconnaissance. Her crew was re-enforced by Lieutenant Helm and 30 men fo the One hundred and first Pennsylvania Volunteers. Hearing that the Spencer Rangers were quartered at Fairfield, Captain McLaughlin proceeded in two launches, surprised the outpost, and captured the whole company, consisting of Captain Spencer, 1 lieutenant, and 26 privates. Much property was taken. This enterprise was conducted in a heavy snow-storm, and entitles all concerned to the highest praise. Another proof is added of the value of our army gun-boats.\n\nI am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nJOHN J. PECK,\n\nMajor-General."

Having ascertained from reliable sources that Richmond was comparatively defenseless, having only about 3,000 local militia with some field batteries and a small force of cavalry, and that Hampton's division of cavalry, numbering not more than 1,500 men, were the only troops of Lee's army at Fredericksburg and between there and Richmond, I thought it practicable by a rapid and secret movement that Richmond, I thought it practicable by a rapid and secret movement that Richmond might be carried by a coup de main, and our prisoners released before re-enforcements from either Petersburg or Lee's army could reach there. Instructions were accordingly given to General Kilpatrick (marked B). *\n\nAt the same time to Sixth Corps, Major-General Sedgwick, was advanced to Madison Court-House, and a cavalry command, 1,500 strong, under Brigadier-General Custer, pushed toward Charlottesville, in advance of Kilpatrick's movement, to distract the enemy's attention and prevent the detachment of any force toward Richmond. It is believed these plans succeeded perfectly so far as deceiving the enemy. General Kilpatrick reached Richmond and move down the south bank, and before reaching the vicinity of Richmond he detached Major Hall with 450 men to attack a force of the enemy near Ashland.\n\nOn reaching the city General Kilpatrick found himself opposed by infantry and artillery, which, in his judgment, rendered any attempt at forcing an entrance extremely hazardous. He accordingly made no serious attempt to enter, but, after some slight and insignificant skirmishing, withdrew his command and hurriedly make his way to Williamsburg.\n\nColonel Dahlgren, having been deceived by his guide, was unable to cross the James, but, following down the left bank, endeavored to enter Richmond about the time of the withdrawal of Kilpatrick. Dahlgren pushed forward vigorously, but the night overtaking him and hearing nothing from Kilpatrick, whose guns he had heard early in the afternoon, he withdrew and attempted to rejoin the main body. The next day Dahlgren became separated from his command, and being ambushed near King and Queen Court-House himself fell mortally wounded, and the small force with him (some 70 or 80 men) fell into the hands of the enemy. The rest of his detachment, under the command of Captain Mitchell, New York cavalry, after encountering numerous bodies of the enemy, succeeded in rejoining Kilpatrick's main force at Tunstall's Station, on the York River Railroad.\n\nCaptain Mitchell's report is herewith submitted, and attention called to the admirable manner in which he handled his small command.\n\nThe report of Brigadier-General Custer, whose expedition to the vicinity of Charlottesville was perfectly successful, is also transmitted herewith. *\n\nOn the return of Brigadier-General Kilpatrick, I caused a thorough inspection of his command to be made, and submit herewith the report of the inspection, showing the number of horses lost and disabled, together with the number of lost arms and equipments.\n\nI also forward a nominal list of the killed, wounded, and missing in General Kilpatrick's command. It is believed the number of killed (2) and wounded (12) will be increased when the missing are finally accounted for. There were no casualties in General Custer's command.\n\nI am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nGEO. G. MEADE,\n\nMajor-General, Commanding.\n\nColonel E. D. TOWNSEND,\n\nAssistant Adjutant-General."

Enemy had four batteries artillery and certainly three regiments infantry, besides cavalry, and were all night and this morning receiving accessions by railroad. Bridge taken up, and all the fords effectually obstructed. A charge on the best-looking ford was gallantry but unsuccessfully executed by Major Wheelan with detachment of Onderdonk's mounted rifles. Loss, 9 killed and wounded; 10 horses killed. At 12 m. to-day, my infantry having arrived by forced marches within 7 miles, I withdrew; could have carried the position with infantry, but not worth while, the main object being defeated. Enemy pursued us to near this place; attacked us at Baltimore Store. Were handsomely repulsed with loss by Third New York Cavalry, Colonel Lewis, and one piece of Belger's battery.

Albert Monroe, First Rhode Island Light Artillery, commanding Artillery Brigade.\n\nHDQRS. ARTILLERY Brigadier, SECOND ARMY CORPS,\nFebruary 11, 1864.\n\nCOLONEL: I respectfully forward the following report of operations of the Artillery Brigade the 6th and 7th instant:\n\nIn accordance with circular dated February 6, 1864, three batteries of the brigade - Arnold's (Battery A, First Rhode Island Light Artillery), Thompson's (Battery C, Independent Pennsylvania Artillery), Rickett's (Battery F, First Pennsylvania Artillery), temporarily under the command of Lieutenant Spence - moved from camp and joined the column near the headquarters of the Third Division. Upon arriving near Morton's Ford, Arnold's and Thompson's batteries were placed in favorable positions on the left bank of the river and above the ford, and one section of Spence's battery (the other two sections being held in reserve) sent under the command of Lieutenant Mitchell about a mile below, where it was placed in position near Stringfellow's house by Lieutenant Roebling, aide-de-camp to the commanding general. About 4. 30 p. m. on the evening of the 6th Captain Arnold fired 42 shells into the enemy's works, with good effect.\n\nOn the morning of the 7th I arose at daybreak, and was surprised to find that the infantry had recrossed the river, not having been informed that the movement had taken place. Lieutenant Goddard was at once sent to withdraw the section near Stringfellow's house, but just as he arrived there the enemy's sharpshooters advanced to the bank, about 250 yards distant on the opposite side of the river, and opened an extremely sharp fire on the section, severely wounding 1 man, Private Frederick Batts. Lieutenant Mitchell, being unaware that the infantry had recrossed the river, mistook the enemy for our own men and allowed them to approach the river without withdrawing his section. At this time the regiment of infantry, which was there for the support of the section, was several hundred yards to the rear and out of supporting distance. Lieutenant Mitchell at once ordered the guns to be limbered to the rear, but the horses attacked to one of the limbers becoming unmanageable, ran away, causing some confusion. So sharp was the enemy's fire that it was impossible to withdraw the guns at once, but the infantry quickly advanced and the pieces were drawn to the rear under their cover, placed in a favorable position, and a few shells fired with effect. The batteries were not employed through the day, and at night returned to camp.\n\nI am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nJ. ALBERT MORNOE,\n\nLieutenant-Colonel and Chief of Artillery."

During the absence the commander here has learned that Boyle reached Richmond, and was arrested and placed in Castle Thunder.

CHESTNEY,\n\nAssistant Adjutant-General.\n\nHEADQUARTERS,\nChaffin's Farm, February 7, 1864.\n\nMAJOR: One of my men (of the Thirty-second Regiment), serving under Lieutenant Hume, has just arrived to give the particulars of the late advance of the enemy. He says he was in 15 yards of the column when it passed. It consisted of one brigade of cavalry, three brigades of infantry, and twelve pieces of artillery. He says that independent of this force there was a large force below, 3 miles below the Burnt Ordinary. He could form no accurate idea of this force, as they were below the scouts; judged it was large from the incessant beating of drums. The cavalry was some distance ahead of the infantry and artillery. He thinks the infantry did not come farther than Barhamsville last night; this is 27 miles from Bottom's Bridge. If he is right in this, the infantry and cavalry had not gotten to Bottom's Bridge before the cavalry fell back. He does not know who commanded the expedition. This scout reports that they killed 3 Yankee sergeants on the upward march. A dispatch just received from Colonel Shinlger says his cavalry pursued the enemy to Crump's Cross-Roads, which is about 5 miles.\n\nNow, if this report of the forces of the enemy is correct (and I have no doubt of it), I am at a loss to understand why the enemy has retired for the small repulse received. Query: Have they abandoned the object of the expedition? I do not yet fell sure of it.\n\nThey brought very few wagons (not over fifteen or twenty in all) and a rapid raid only seems to have been contemplated. It would not surprise me if they had fallen back to make a better start, probably on some other road. I shall keep up the utmost diligence until I am satisfied. Please inform me if I shall recall the infantry and Major Stark's artillery, as soon as Colonel Shingler is satisfied the expedition is abandoned. Please answer this last inquiry to-night.\n\nRespectfully, &c.,\n\nEPPA HUNTON,\n\nBrigadier-General."

PARSONS,\nActing Assistant Adjutant-General, Cavalry Corps:\n\nCAPTAIN; In compliance with orders from headquarters Cavalry Corps, I have the honor to report that on the morning of the 12th instant I proceeded to Washington City and reported to the President of the United States, as directed in an order dated headquarters Cavalry Corps, February 12, 1864.\n\nBy direction of the President I afterward reported to the honorable Secretary of War and submitted, at his request, the following plan as, in my opinion, the most practicable to accomplish the double purpose of distributing the President's amnesty proclamation to the rebel command in our front, and to the inhabitants of Virginia in the various counties about Richmond; as also to destroy, as far as practicable, the enemy's communications, and attempt the release of our prisoners at Richmond.\n\nPlan. -I propose, with a force of not less than 4,000 cavalry and six guns, to cross the Rapidan River at Ely's Ford and proceed to Spotsylvania Court-House, from that point to send a sufficient force of cavalry to destroy the Virginia Central Railroad at or near Frederick's Hill, to prevent infantry re-enforcements being sent from Lee's army, scouts having been sent to cut the telegraph on crossing the Rapidan River; also to send a force to destroy the Fredericksburg railroad at or near Guiney's Station, the telegraph on this road having also been previously destroyed. These parties, and others that it may be found necessary to detach, will scatter the proclamation along the line of march. With the main force I propose to move to Carmel Church and cross the North Anna River near that point, destroy the railroad bridge 3 miles below, and proceed to Hanover Junction, unless the force stationed there is found to be too large, in which case I will avoid that point. The force sent to Guiney's Station will proceed to Goochland Court-House, destroy the canal, cross the James River, proceed down the south bank., destroy the arsenal at Bellona; also the Danville and Richmond and Petersburg and Richmond Railroads, this force afterward to act as circumstances may require. From Hanover Junction I will proceed down the Brook pike between the two railroads, cross the brook and move on Richmond, and if possible, in conjunction with troops sent from the direction of West Point, make an attempt to release our prisoners. Should this be found impossible the command can return by way of Fredericksburg, or seek temporary safety at West Point. The command will need but five days' rations and one of forage; no wagons.\n\nFrom the information I have but lately received, and from my thorough knowledge of the country, I am satisfied that this plan can be safely and successfully carried out.\n\nRespectfully submitted.\n\nJ. KILPATRICK,\n\nBrigadier-General of Volunteers."

MEADE,\nCommanding Army of the Potomac:\n\nGENERAL: I am instructed to bring to your notice two papers found upon the body of Colonel U. Dahlgren, who was killed while commanding a part of the Federal cavalry during the late expedition of General Kilpatrick. * To enable you to understand the subject fully I have the honor to inclose photographic copies of the papers referred to, one of which is an address to his officers and men, bearing the official signature of Colonel Dahlgren, and the other, not signed, contains more detailed explanations of the purpose of the expedition and more specific instructions as to its execution. In the former this passage occurs:\n\nWe hope to release the prisoners from Belle Island first, and having seen them fairly started, we will cross the James River into Richmond, destroying the brigades after us and exhorting the released prisoners to destroy and burn the hateful city; and do not allow the rebel leader Davis and his traitorous crew to escape. The prisoners must render great assistance, as you cannot leave your ranks too far or become too much scattered, or you will be lost.\n\nAmong the instructions contained in the second paper are the following:\n\nTeh bridges once secured, and the prisoners loose and over the river, the bridges will be secured and the city destroyed. The men must keep together and well in hand, and once in the city it must be destroyed and Jeff. Davis and cabinet killed. Pioneers will go along with combustible material.\n\nIn obedience to my instructions I beg leave respectfully to inquire whether the designs and instructions of Colonel Dahlgren, as set fort in these papers, particularly those contained in the above extracts, were authorized by the United States Government or by his superior officers, and also whether they have the sanction and approval of those authorities.\n\nI have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nR. E. LEE,\n\nGeneral."

This fact is acknowledged in two of the Richmond papers, the Examiner and the Sentinel, published the day after the attack, and is fully confirmed by the testimony before the court-martial, before which is being tried the man who permitted the escape. I beg leave to call your attention to the suggestion of General Wistar in his report, that the effect of the raid will be to hereafter keep as many troops around Richmond for its defense from any future movement of the Army of the Potomac as we have in this neighborhood.\n\nI have the honor to be, your obedient servant,\n\nBEJN.

Bull, One hundred and twenty-sixth New York Infantry.\n\nHEADQUARTERS 126TH NEW YORK VOLUNTEERS,\nFebruary 9, 1864.\n\nCAPTAIN: I have the honor to report that my regiment left camp Saturday morning, the 6th instant, at 7 a. m., and formed in rear of the brigade, and proceeded on the Morton's Ford road to a point about a mile this side of the Rapidan, where the brigade halted and formed in column by battalion under cover of a piece of woods. At this point 100 men were detailed as skirmishers, comprising men of eight companies with their officers, viz, Companies A, B, E, F, H., I, and K. This detail, under command of Lieutenant Colonel William H. Baird, with the others from the brigade, marched to and crossed the Rapidan at Morton's Ford and took part in capturing about 30 rebel prisoners at or near the ford. Immediately after fording the river the skirmishers were deployed as such, and advanced and were very soon warmly engaged with those of the enemy. They continued on duty until relieved about 7 o'clock in the evening, and recrossed the river under orders about midnight.\n\nI accompanied the detail of skirmishers across the river, where, as soon as the residue of the regiment, marching in column, reached me, I placed it, by order of General Owen, on the left of the brigade, in a road running nearly at right angles with the river. There we remained until about 6 p. m., when we moved out of the road, deployed, and strengthened the skirmish line on the left, where we remained until about 12 o'clock, when we were withdrawn and recrossed the river, joining the portion of the regiment under command of Lieutenant-Colonel Baird. Soon after we bivouacked in the woods about a mile from the river. We remained in this locality until nearly dark, when we took up our line of march, arriving in camp before 9 p. m.\n\nIt affords me great pleasure to say that the officers and men of my command, both on the march and on the field, behaved in a manner satisfactory to me and creditable to themselves.\n\nThe casualties are as follows: One killed, 19 wounded (1 of whom has since died), and 2 wounded and missing.\n\nVery respectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nJAMES M. BULL,\n\nColonel, Commanding Regiment."

Everything worked precisely as I expected. The troops reached Bottom's Bridge, 10 miles from Richmond, at 2. 30 o'clock on Sunday morning, but we found a force of the enemy posted there to meet us, evidently informed of our intention, none having been there before for two months. They had destroyed the bridge and fallen threes across the road to prevent the passing of the cavalry. Finding the enemy were informed and prepared, we were obliged to retire. The flag-of-truce boat came down from Richmond to-day, bringing a copy of the Examiner, in which it is said that they were prepared for us from information received from a Yankee deserter. Who that deserter was that gave the information you will see by a dispatch just received by me from General Wistar. I send it to you that you may see how your clemency has been misplaced. I desire that you will revoke your order suspending executions in this department. Please answer by telegraph."

TENTH BATTALION NEW YORK VOLUNTEERS,\nFebruary 8, 1864.\n\nSIR: I have the honor to forward the following report of the part taken by this command in the action of the 6th instant:\n\nWe left camp about 9 o'clock on the morning of the 6th instant, taking our position on the left of the brigade line; crossed the Rapidan at Morton's Ford in the early part of the afternoon, and took position in line of battle upon a slight eminence about 1 mile from the ford, under a fire from the enemy's battery stationed opposite our right.\n\nJust before dark the enemy opened upon our line with artillery and musketry. We were advanced about 20 yards, taking position on the crest of the hill upon the left of the One hundred and eighth Regiment New York State Volunteers. Here one of our men was struck in the knee by a minie-ball; he has since died. Shortly after dark we were ordered to advance with the One hundred and eighth New York Volunteers and capture a house about 500 yards to our front, and at this time held and occupied by the enemy's skirmishers. Captain Everett, of the One hundred and eighth, took command and we silently advanced in line, crossing several ravines and scaling a high fence. Upon arriving at the house we were ordered to fire and charge, and a terrible volley was poured into the house, which was followed by a charge from our line, driving the enemy from the buildings and adjacent ground.\n\nAfter reforming, this command was ordered to the rear and to its position of the afternoon. A few minutes after our arrival at the position in question we were ordered by General Owen, and afterward by General Hays, to convey the wounded from the barn occupied as a hospital to the ford. We were occupied at this work until after our division had left the field. Every wounded man was removed from the hospital. No stretchers were sent from this side of the river to the hospital of the Second Brigade, and we were compelled to remove the wounded upon extemporized conveyances of blankets, boards, &c. I crossed the river with a remnant of the men of my command about an hour after the last of the division had crossed, and rejoined the brigade early next morning.\n\nDuring the action we lost 3 wounded; 1 of these has since died, and another suffered amputation of a foot.\n\nMy command numbered 4 commissioned officers and 65 enlisted men. Thirty of these men were recruits who had not handled a musket until a day or two previous. They were first drilled in loading and firing on the morning of the 6th instant before leaving camp. It is owing to the perseverance and bravery of the commissioned and non-commissioned officers, and some of the older soldiers of the command, that they acquitted themselves so well during the afternoon and morning.\n\nVery respectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nGEORGE M. DEWEY,\n\nCaptain, Commanding Battalion."

Lieutenant Vertegans, of the same regiment, of whom the major speaks in complimentary terms, will start to-morrow for Richmond with Brigadier-General Scammon and the 2 officers of his staff- Lieutenants Pinckard and Millward. Major Nounnan and his small party, especially Lieutenant Vertegans, have performed their duty in the most creditable manner.\n\nI sent Colonel Ferguson with his regiment (the Sixteenth Virginia Cavalry) to the Lower Kanawha late in December last. He has so far conducted the expedition with judgment and discretion; has captured much of the enemy's property and a number of prisoners, and diverted the attention of the enemy in that quarter from this part of the country to the protection of their own border.\n\nVery respectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nSAM.

The battalion was then deployed as skirmishers, and commenced advancing, when we were ordered to and did reform and return to the north side of the river, leaving Captain Hamilton with 50 men on the island near the ford. The balance of the battalion proceeded to the position last occupied before crossing the river. Captain Hamilton and the men left with him remained on and near the island during picket duty until 3. 30 p. m. yesterday, when he was relieved and rejoined the regiment. Last evening, at 7 o'clock, we left this last position and returned to camp, arriving about 9 p. m.\n\nVery respectfully,\n\nG. W. THOMPSON,\n\nLieutenant-Colonel, Commanding."

Learned here that there were several guerrillas in the immediate vicinity, and that a small party of them had on the 6th instant hung a man by the name of Judd, and learned from him that there were 84 men, under Captain Evans, about 10 miles from Thomasville, awaiting our approach. We found that we could do but little with twice our number of men, whom we heard were well mounted and armed. Lieutenant bold dispatched our situation to headquarters at Houston. The command encamped at Judd's, having marched 15 miles. 8th.-Scouted and foraged in the neighborhood; camped at Prock's, having marched 10 miles. 9th.-About 7 o'clock Lieutenant Hillerich arrived from Houston with 50 men and one piece of artillery. We soon formed in order, intending to march for Thomasville, when am an came from that place and informed us that Captain Evans had found out that we were expecting re-enforcements and had started before daylight in the direction of Perkins' place, on Warm Fork of Spring River. We immediately changed our course, intending, if possible, to fall in with Captain Evans; marched 24 miles, and camped at Roberts'. 10th.-Started in good time and marched to the Thomasville and Batesville road. Had gone about 1 miles when we saw 3 men coming toward us, who see in guns turned and ran. We pursued and shot one of them; the others escaped. We then continued our march toward Spring River Mills, and about 3 miles farther on we took a man whose name was Ben Carter; but he thought us Southern troops, and when the command came up he recognized some among them and immediately broke and ran, nor could he be made to stop until the was shot down. We camped on Warm Fork, about 1 miles above the head of Spring River. In the evening we took 15 men and went up Two-Mile Creek; saw two men run from a house; we pursued and killed one of them, but the other escaped; returned to camp, having marched to-day 25 miles. 11th.-Last night we were fired into. The men fell in in good order and promptly returned the fire. Two rounds were fired on each side, and the firing ceased. In about a half hour they returned and gave us another volley. Our guard, which was detailed for the purpose, attacked and drove them back. They returned in an hour and fired six or seven shots, but our fire was too strong for them and they left. None of our men were hurt. We heard nothing more of the rebels that night.\n\nIn the morning we started for James' Creek. Had marched about 3 miles when we found a house in which were stored two barrels of salt, some guns, and ammunition. We burned the house and everything in it, not allowing any contraband property to be removed at all. We had just reached safe distance from the house when we heard a loud report, which we afterwards learned was made by a keg of gunpowder which had been concealed under the floor of the house. We then marched to James' Creek and camped. Lieutenant Hillerich took 15 men and went a man who said he could on us to the house of the rebel Captain Orchards. We proceeded on our way a half mile farther, when we took another man. This man gave his name Henery, and he looked somewhat frightened. We asked him if he knew of any troops being in that neighborhood. He said that he did not. We then asked him where Freeman was,to which he replied that he knew nothing of Freeman whatever, or of any other command. While pursued and killed 2 of them; one of them proved to be William Lamb, a brother-in-law to Freeman and acting quartermaster to Freeman's regiment. Henery said to the men who guarded him, as soon as we started in the chase, that we had better be called back, for Freeman was camped less than 2 miles below with a strong force; but the information came too late to stop us, and in the charge we got scattered, and when all assembled at the starting point one of the scouts was missing (Woods). One of the men reported that he had seen, while passing through the woods, several men well armed and mounted, and this, together with the prisoner's statement of Freeman's camp, caused our squad to return to camp, thinking that Woods might have gone before them, but when they arrived in camp they found that he had not yet come in, and he was supposed to be taken in by the rebels. The command was in motion soon and moving in the direction of Freeman's camp; had marched about 1 mile when Woods came in all right. A council was then held, and it was determined that we should return to our camp, pick our ground, and prepare to act on the defensive in case of an attack, which we looked for that night. Marched that day 20 miles.",

I at once concluded to try and catch them, if possible; so I left with 21 men on the evening of the 24th instant [ultimo] at 8 p. m., taking an old and indirect route, determined not to be seen, traveled until 4 a. m. of the 25th, and secreted myself in a canon until 9 p. m., then started again and went within about 3 miles of the town, hid again, and sent in a spy. He returned before daylight, saying there were no Indians there; so I laid over, hid in the thick brush, intending to lie there as long as I could to await for their arrival in town. They came about noon; word came, and I started to the place at about 5 p. m., arriving there them, and I killed 13, including the notorious chief Louis, successor to Mangas Colorado, chief of the Gila tribes. In my opinion not one escaped with a whole hide. This chief is the same that killed Private Bay, of Company D, First Infantry, California Volunteers, at Fort West, last fall, and the same that I had a fight with in Sierra Blanca Mountains in September last. I also captured a Mexican woman from them (whose narrative I append to this report as containing some very useful information) and one pony and bows and arrows in abundance. I followed the who escaped the next day about 7 or 8 miles, but could not overtake them. Returned safely to camp on the 29th without the slightest accident of any kind; not aman hurt. Marijenia Figueira says:\n\nMy father's family lived at Banamichi, a small mining town in Sonora. When I was seven years old the town was attacked by Indians. Myself an sister were taken prisoners and carried off; also a few other children of the town; besides this all the people of the town were killed, including my father and mother. This is my sister, the wife of Julian Aguirre. She was a prisoner five years; I have been a prisoner fifteenth years; am twenty-two years old. During the whole time I have been slave for Louis and his family; have been treated well; have never been married; have no children. Louis and 3 warriors were all of Mangas Colorado's tribe that were here; all the others were of the Chriricahu tribe. Louis and all of the warriors belonging to his tribe were killed; he was acting chief of the party. If we had got off well this time Cochise and his tribe would have come next time. All the Indians that came with this party were living near the mouth of Black River. We came by Fort West; have been eight days coming. The Navasjoies are at war with all the other tribes that I know of. They took all our stock; left us very poor; very poor indeed. We have no stock except 3 pies, and 1 of these the soldiers got last night. We have no dried meat; have nothing to live upon except mescal; have no dried mescal; have a very hard matter to gather enough to do from day to day. Can occasionally kill a deer. Have no powder or guns. Our guns ae nearly all worn out. We only get a little powder occasionally, when we can kill somebody. The Navajoes got some of our guns. We have no clothing. We have to live down in the valleys. We can not live up in the mountains; it is too cold. Runon and Victoria get powder and lead from aman named Zuloago,who is always on fierily terms with us, even when his Government is at war with us. Runnon and Victoria are bothover this way somewhere. I think Runnon and part of his people are in the Florida Mountains or at Lake Guzman to make campaigns against Las Cruces and Mimbres River.\n\nWilliam Aguirre is a citizen of Pinos Altos, and the captured woman was turned over to him. She desires to live with her sister. I feel it to be my duty to acknowledge valuable service rendered by Mr. William Market, in connection with this report; also Mr. Julian Aguirre.\n\nVery respectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nJAMES H. WHITLOCK,\n\nCaptain Fifth Infantry, California Volunteers, Commanding.\n\nColonel GEORGE W. BOWIE,\n\nCommanding District of Arizona, Franklin, Tex.",

Phillips, Third Indiana Home Guard, commanding Indiana Brigade.\n\nLITTLE RIVERTOWN, NEAR OLD FORT ARBUCKLE,\n\nCreek Nation, February 16, 1864.\n\nSIR: After heavy marching, day and night, I have reached this point, 105 miles from Fort Gibson, at which point my infantry and wagons under Colonel Wattles had reached night before last. With the force I took farthest south (450 mounted men and 1 howitzer) I could, of course, not fight the enemy after they had concentrated.\n\nThey declined sending any parties to height me, evidently designing to fight me on Red River in force, which was, of course, out of the question. I regret the non-arrival of the force promised me from Fort Smith, as I could have then been justified in attempting to drive them into Texas before they could complete their organization. I have, however, fully accomplished all the specific instructions of General McNeil with my present force.\n\nI sent a force up the Canadian to the Seminole country to sweep north to the Arkansas, crossing and marching to Gibbon on the north side; Major Foreman with another up Little River to pursue the same course. I shall send another up North Fork and return with my baggage and forage train direct to Gibson. I am getting out an ox train from the county with wagons to haul to Gibson what corn there is that my command do not use. I hope to be able to get oxen enough to make a commissary train for my command as soon as grass grows.\n\nWe have left behind us copies of the President's proclamation in the Indian languages. I learned that General Maxey was present with the Choctaw legislature ten days ago, and urged them to remain at home and raise crops. There were delegations present from the Choctaw Nation, Creek (rebel portion), Cherokee (rebel portion), Chickasaw, &c. The Choctaws urged a separate confederacy, as the rebel Confederacy was unable to protect them. The rebel Creeks were preparing to fly into the Wichita Mountains. General Maxey has got De Morse's Twenty-ninth Texas Cavalry, Martin's Fifth Texas Partisan Rangers, Bass' Twentieth Cavalry, Scanland's and Gillett's battalions cavalry, besides two full batteries of 6 and 12 pounder brass and three howitzer. The two batteries have just been received and inclose two rifled guns. He has of Indian troops, Colonel Watie, First and Second Cherokee; what is left of the Second Creek Regiment (which amounts to little). There are two Chactaw regiments, if they do not slough off at this time, which is probable, and Colonel Jumper's regiment, which consisted of the Chickasaw and Seminole battalions, but was broken to pieces in the late battle. In addition to this, General Maxey is conscripting every man on Red River. As an offset, I am happy to be able to say that all the Canadian Valley and it tributaries are clear of rebels. I shall sweep out the upper Seminole country as I return. I shall sheave no subsistence for a rebel army, or forage, so that all it supplies must come from Red River in any movement toward the Arkansas, the stretch being 180 miles. The rebel Indians are entirely disheartened and discouraged. General Maxey urged that they remain to raise a crop, promising to place his force between the Canadian and Fort Gibson, and that they should be protected. His utter failure to do so will throw a damper on the efforts he has made to reorganize.\n\nIt has rained a great deal in the past two days. I expect the many streams in this county to be filled soon, and, of course, shall records them to my base before the rise. General Maxey has either to content himself with defending North Texas, in which case he will lose his Indiana, allies, or recover the prestige which he had lost by our recent successes in an attack on us on the Arkansas River, which he must do under great difficulties, and which i should much prefer that he would undertake at this season of the year, under all circumstances.\n\nWhile I could not accomplish all I would have done had I been supported by Colonel Moonlight's command, and able to enter Northern Texas, still the result, in view of the condition and temper of the rebel Indians, is, I think, highly satisfactory, and will materially reduce their power to plant a force of these rebel Indians on the Arkansas River the coming spring.\n\nI have the honor to remain, very respectfully,\n\nWM. A. PHILLIPS,\n\nColonel, Commanding.\n\nMajor-General CURTIS,\n\nCommanding Department of Kansas.",

Faries, Pelican (Louisiana) Battery.\n\nIN THE FIELD, NEAR HARRISONBURG, LA.,\n\nMarch 2, 1864.\n\nSIR: I have the honor to report that I took position with the right section of this battery (two 3-inch rifled guns), at daylight this morning, on a large circular Indian mound in an old field about midway between Harrisonburg and Bayou Bushly, which enters the Ouachita River on its right bank about 800 yards below the mound. This mound is 200 yards from the right bank of the river. At 10 a. m. the iron-clad gun-boat Osage of the enemy turned the point at the junction of the Ouachita and Bayou Bushly, followed by four tin-clads, armed stern-wheel river steamers, protected by a covering of boiler iron, pierced for guns below and for musketry where it covered the cabins, which were occupied by Federal infantry. I commenced firing at 10.30 a. m., soon after our infantry on the open river bank below me had opened the fight. Forty-seven time-fused shell and 16 solid shot were fired at the four tin-clads where they had halted just below my position, distance 400 yards. Nearly all of the shot and shell from the two 3-inch rifles took effect in the pilot-houses and upper works of the four tin-clads, all of which lay together in a mass. The damage by my fire was, I believe, considerable, as I could perceive the effect of the greater part of my shot. After exhausting the ammunition in the limber chests, I retired the section by piece until they had reached the cover of the woods to the left and rear. The Indian mound is some 10 feet in height. A curved ditch was cut through the level surface near the river face of the circle, which was occupied from daylight until the action was well opened by the two companies of infantry under Captain ---, who had reported to me at 2 o'clock in the morning.\n\nWhile in position on the mound the tin-clads did not attempt to pass above. Only the iron-clad Osage passed up, she being so low in the water (the river being very low) no part of her hull was visible from the mound, her funnel alone indicating her movements. The ground being unfavorable for the protection of my caissons and horses, I had them placed in charge of Sergeant-Major Arnauld, some distance in my rear on the Bushly Ferry road, from which position they had to be retired, as most of the projectiles from the enemy's guns passed over my position and exploded at or near the caissons.\n\nThe enemy's vessels were armed with 6, 8 and 11-inch guns, 30-pounder Parrott rifles; also 12 and 24 pounder guns, from which were thrown during the day an immense quantity of shot, shell, spherical case, and grape, their explosive projectiles bursting with considerable accuracy toward the latter part of the firing. In a direct fire they were unable to depress their guns sufficiently to do me any damage while occupying the mound. My horses and pieces sustained no injury, the only exception being the animal ridden by myself, which was killed while I was in the act of reporting to General Polignac for orders near the bank of the river above the mound. I have no casualties to report.\n\nI am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nT. A. FARIES,\n\nCaptain, Commanding Battery, Second Division Infantry.\n\nMajor O. VOORHIES,\n\nActg. Asst. Adjt. General, Second Brigadier, Louisiana Infty.",

McCaleb, Second Mississippi Heavy Artillery, African Descent.\n\nHDQRS. 2nd MISSISSIPPI ARTILLERY AFRICAN DESCENT,\nNatchez, Miss., February 9, 1864.\n\nLIEUTENANT: I most respectfully submit the following as a correct account of the action of my command, in pursuance to your order of the 7th instant, which was received by me at 2.30 p. m.of same date:\n\nYou will get your command in readiness and cross the river by the first boat to Vidalia, La., and report to Colonel Farrar, who is being pressed by overwhelming numbers of the enemy.\n\nUpon received the order, I at once formed a line of every able bodied man in camp, and leaving instructions with the senior convalescent officer to detail a camp guard from the convalescents, I started on double-quick to the landing with seven companies, numbering in all 432 men. To account clearly for the remainder of my command I will call your attention to orders issued by you some time since, detaching one company (A), under command of Captain james T. Organ, as mounted scouts for the post of Vidalia, and one battalion (Third) of our companies, under Major George D. Reynolds, to take charge of the siege guns in the fortifications surrounding Camp McPherson. This latter battalion being not armed with small-arms, I deemed it prudent to let them remain at Camp McPherson, although ot officers and men begged eagerly for permission to accompany me.\n\nOn arriving at the landing I was met by Colonel Kent, who ordered me to embark with my command on the steamer Diligent as quickly as possible, which was done at the double-quick, and at the tap of the bell the lines were unfastened and we were sailing to help our comrades at Vidalia. At the landing on the Louisiana shore there was an orderly with orders from Colonel Farrar to form my line of battle in front of the levee and await further orders; this was soon done, and soon an order came from Colonel Farrar to move out on the Trinity road 150 yards and form a new line, with one battalion of three companies on the right, under command of Major Charles W. Smith, the other of four companies on the left of the road, commanded by myself, to support the section of artillery planted directly in the road, with an interval between of sufficient space to work the artillery.\n\nThis being done, I received orders to detach 30 men to occupy and defend the jail building. This I obeyed. About this time heavy skirmishing began on our front, and soon the rebel flag was seen advancing toward our left, from the skirt of woods across the level plain, and next their main column came plainly in sight. Judging from the length of their line and number of flags, there were in this column tow regiments, numbering from 1,200 to 1,500 men in all, marching in line of battle, one regiment a few rods in rear of the other, and distant from us about one-half miles. At this time I was ordered to move my battalion to a high piece of ground to my left oblique, about 300 yards, and join Captain organ, who had command of his own and one company of the Seventh Louisiana, my left to rest near his right; the whole command faced to the left from my first position. By the time I had reached this point the enemy's skirmishers had advanced near enough to become very annoying, and although my men had never before been under fire they came up promptly on the double-quick and formed a line, under a heavy skirmish fire, with as much coolness as could veterans of many battles. This checked the advance of their skirmishes, who were now from 75 to 100 paces in front of our line.\n\nOn their main body came in spending style, carrying their arms at a support, presenting a most formidable front, until within about 150 or 200 yards distant, when I received orders from Colonel Farrar to open fire, which I immediately gave to the men, and they executed it by giving one splendid volley, well aimed. This caused the enemy to falter and lie down. I immediately ordered the men to load, which they did with great coolness, and with one more well-aimed volley the rebel ranks were broken, and their men, panic-stricken, ran away in great confusion. I ordered my men to load and fire by file at the fleeing mob, and with difficulty prevented them from breaking ranks to follow mob, and with difficulty prevented them from breaking ranks to follow the enemy, their anxiety being great to do so. I received no orders to advance. I held my position until a late hour at night, when I received orders to fall back to the levee.\n\nThus a force of 300 colored soldiers put to flight, in great confusion, four or five times their number of the chivalrous enemy, with a loss to them of 1 killed, 5 wounded (some mortally), and a number of prisoners. Not a man of my command was hurt. The line officers and men did their whole duty. Captain James T. Organ, commanding two companies, maneuvered them with skill and behaved with gallantry.\n\nMajor Charles W. Smith, commanding battalion in reserve, informs me that he and the line officers of his command were obliged to place themselves before their men with drawn swords, and threaten summary punishment to the first man who would attempt to quit the ranks to join their comrades fighting in the front, their eagerness to be engaged being almost irrepressible.\n\nto Surgeons Ferris, Peal, and Mitchell are due the thanks of the offices and men of the regiment for their thoughtfulness in following with the means to make the men comfortable.\n\nHoping the action of my command will meet your approval, I have the honor to be, your most obedient servant,\n\nH. A. McCALEB,\n\nLieutenant Colonel, Commanding Second Mississippi Artillery.\n\nLieutenant BOZMAN,\n\nActg. Asst. Adjt. General, Camp McPherson.",

Lieutenant Bold's report shows that he penetrated several miles into Arkansas, and was at one time within about 3 miles of Colonel Freeman's camp, though at the time not aware of his proximity. From information gained, the lieutenantsays Freeman's whole force may be estimated at from 400 to 500 men, and that they are very poorly armed and supplies with ammunition. The scout was frequently fired on from the brush while below Thomasville. The lieutenant returned the fire a number of times and in this way killed 7 of the guerrillas, including Colonel Freeman's quartermaster, Lieutenant Lamb. He also captured and brought in 3 prisoners, 8 horses, 2 mules, and a few worthless guns.\n\nI would respectfully suggest that if a scout of about three companies was sent down to Spring River and allowed to remain there for a fortnight, they could effectual break up this band of thieves. Lieutenant Bold reports that there is plenty of forage for a force of 300 for the period mentioned, and that subsistence can easily be obtained for that number of men.\n\nI have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nRICHARD MURPHY,\n\nCaptain, Commanding.\n\nCaptain J. LOVELL,\n\nAsst. Adjt. General, Rolla, Mo.",

On the 25th of February, 1864, I crossed White River, reaching Yellville on the 26th. In conformity to an order received prior to my departure from Springfield, Mo., I dispatched 30 men to escort refugees desiring to emigrate to Springfield, Mo. Traversing the country situate between Sugar Loaf Prairie and Yellville, Ark., I encountered a band of guerrillas, killed 2 men, who, as I subsequently ascertained, belonged to Major Gunning's command.\n\nI took up line of march from Yellville on the morning of the 28th, halting 30 miles from Yellville and 6 miles below Buffalo City, in vicinity of which I remained three days, scouring the country on both sides of the river. March 1, I sent detachment, Lieutenant Overman, Company H, Sixth Missouri State Militia, in command, with orders to proceed down river on opposite side, to which my operations were confined. I now had only 40 men left remaining with me. About 10 o'clock on morning of 1st, while near or not far from Buffalo City, I encountered a band of guerrillas, killed Lieutenant J. B. Smith, Eighth Missouri Infantry, of C. S. Army, and a man named Charles Cain, known as a desperado, and regarded with terror by all loyal citizens. Meanwhile Lieutenant Overman was contending with a band of Tracy's men, not far distant, and succeeded in killing 2 of the band and capturing 3. One of the men killed was of the name of Heron; the other, a Baptist preacher, whose name I do not know. On morning of March 2, I left White River, 8 miles above Calico Rock, crossed mountain to Bennett's Bayou, on North Fork White River, where I came in contact with about 50 guerrillas with Tracy at their head. They had there murdered a Union man named Anderson and a negro. On my approach Tracy dispersed his men among the hills and fired upon my command from behind rocks and trees, but without effect.\n\nOn the morning of March 3, deployed small detachments of skirmishers, thoroughly scoured Bennett's Bayou, killed Frank Russell, a notorious guerrilla from Wright County, Mo.,, and a man of the name of Howard, from Fulton County, Ark.; also captured one of Freeman's gang. Thence proceeded through Texas and Wright Counties, Mo., to Springfield, where I turned over to district provost-marshal Southwest Missouri all the property captured during scout, and which consisted of 16 horses and a number of fire-arms, such as shotguns, rifles, & c. I found forage in abundance during whole of scout.\n\nI am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nELI HUGHES,\n\nCaptain Company K, Sixth Cavalry, Missouri State Militia.\n\nBrigadier General J. B. SANBORN.",

Were you a fugitive from fear, or did you flee as a man who wants to be an enemy? Had you come to me frankly you would have found a friend. The Government has not believed that you really desired to fight it, but your conduct leaves the matter in great doubt and will expose your people. Why did you send for soldiers to keep the troops of the United States out of the Chickasaw Nation? Your treaties require you to admit their presence. Are we to understand that you now want formally to break these treaties? These questions must be answered, and answered soon. Your power as head man was not given you to gratify your prejudice or pride. You are responsible to your people, and have no right to expose them to ruin when the Government offers them mercy.\n\nThe President has issued a proclamation in which he offers pardon and peace to those who, even in this moment of its destruction, abandoned this wicked and unnecessary war. You cannot fail to see the end coming. Are you justified in shutting the eyes of your people to it? The offer Government of the United States will soon crush all the enemies. Let me know if you want to be among them.\n\nI send you some letters by a prisoners to head men of some Indiana nations; deliver them; they have a right to know what the United States Government says. Their blood may be upon you if you neglect it. I shall hold you accountable for their safe delivery.\n\nI remain, with respect, yours, &c.,\n\nWM. A. PHILLIPS,\n\nColonel, Commanding U. S.

He left camp on the 12th instant. He reports that he proceeded first to Montevallo, in Vernon County, from thence scouted through the counties of Cedar and Benton. I did not see or hear of any guerrillas in that section, nor see anything that would indicate that there had been any there in the last month. He reports that there are but few inhabitants in that section of the country; the most of the houses in that part have either been burned or vacated. He returned with his command on the evening of the 18th, without any casualties whatever. Distance traveled about 300 miles. Reports forage tolerably plenty.\n\nI have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nGEO. W. MURPHY,\n\nCaptain, Commanding Sixth Missouri State Militia Cavalry."

If so, Taopee and other of the friendly Indians must have known of their presence, and should have given the necessary information to the military authorities, that they might be apprehended. I will be obliged to you if you will make diligent inquiry into the facts of the case as it is requisite I should know if any of the Indians supposed to be friendly, and enjoying the protection of the whites at or near Faribault have so far forgotten their obligations of good faith as to conceal hostile and criminal Indians who have ventured to appear among them. A prompt investigation and reply will be thankfully acknowledged.\n\nVery respectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nH. H. SIBLEY,\n\nBrigadier-General, Commanding."

STONE,\n\nChief of Staff:\n\nGENERAL: I have the honor to call attention to the levees in this State, and ask that they may be repaired under the direction of the provost-marshal's department. That department has its officers everywhere, and whatever their duties, they cannot be so onerous but that the matter of levees can be attended to by them. All negroes have been converted into soldiers, and I am deprived of labor for my department, for it is impossible to get any colored troops to work, either through the worthlessness of officers or their too great individual influence. The best white troops that the world ever saw are and have been those that have been made to toil constantly.\n\nIt is simply impossible for me to build levees this year, and I would urge that the negroes upon the plantations, Government and others, be put to work immediately under their own oversees and the general direction of the provost-marshals. There are large plantations where no negroes can be enlisted nor carried away. The expense of tools and materials should be assessed against these plantations, for they cannot be considered a legitimate charge against quartermasters' appropriations. None of the proceeds of these plantations come into my hands; they go to the Treasury and private parties. It is no more right that my time and energies should be employed at this than in any other private or State interest.\n\nAll control of plantations and their revenues have been surrendered; let the parties receiving them be made to do the work of their own self-preservation and bear the expenditures thereof. It will not be done voluntarily, and the State government seems to take no interest andd exercise no authority in such matters. The railroad will probably be flooded and impassable from New Orleans to Brashear when the river reaches its height; the Bonnet Carre country likewise. The levee on the opposite bank of the river from New Orleans to Donaldsonville and thence down Bayou La Fourche requires examination and repair. I have never been able to procure recruits for a regiment of quartermaster's men to man steamers on account of the selfishness of interested enrolling officers, or other causes.\n\nThey whole scheme which I advocated so strongly, to my mind, is a failure in many respects; our labor is crippled, the expenses of the quartermaster's department doubled as regards employes, and in many other respects, and while our labor is all disposed of, our fighting force has not in fact been so rapidly increased. Why cannot all plantation hands be put upon the levee this winter? Why cannot I get 1,000 such hands at Brashear City, or two colored regiments? Why cannot the colored troops at Port Hudson do their own quartermaster labor? Why cannot 1,000 be employed and sent across the lake to procure lumber and timber to house those remaining behind? Why cannot I have regiments in my department as well as the engineers?\n\nI have the honor to be, most respectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nS. B. HOLABIRD,\n\nColonel, Chief Quartermaster."

SCATES,\n\nAssistant Adjutant-General:\n\nCOLONEL: I had the honor in my last report to call attention to the fact that my men were much in want of proper clothing, and beg leave to say once more that they are absolutely suffering for want of the same. Our means of communicating with headquarters are limited, and consequently cannot send the regimental quartermaster away with any certainty when he could return. Requisitions have been made out and forwarded, but fail, as yet, to receive any return. The health of the regiment is excellent, and I have now on the island at this post an aggregate of 360; this is exclusive of Captain Altmann's company, which is doing provost duty at headquarters of Major-General Dana, and I am expecting daily the convalescents from New Orleans, as I have taken steps to have them forwarded to the regiment.\n\nPermit me again to state that our tents are worn out, yet we have quite comfortable quarters for the men, which we built since coming here. I learn that the troops have generally been paid up to January 1, 1864. My regiment has not received any pay since August 31, 1863, and many are in great need of money, especially of officers, and, if possible, I would urge that the provost-marshal be directed to pay us before leaving for New Orleans. The fortifications have been nearly completed several times, and are sufficiently advanced at present so that the guns are in position and can be used, but the sand out of which they are constructed is so light and dry that the winds blow it away, and it is almost impossible to keep the works in repair. Captain Blanchard, of the engineers, has caused large quantities of sea grass to be gathered and placed upon the works, and sowed oats on them, with seems to prevent the destruction by the wind very much, and may, with care and attention, obviate the difficulty entirely. We experience considerable difficulty in procuring firewood, having but two wagons at the post.\n\nMy scouts have several times been in Corpus Christi, and find no enemy. Deserters still continue to come in slowly. I have no doubt that if we were on the mainland very many deserters would come into our lines, and there is not the least difficulty in taking possession of and holding Corpus Christi at any time it may be deemed proper.\n\nRespectfully,\n\nWM. G. THOMPSON,\n\nMajor, Commanding Twentieth Iowa and Post Aransas."

General:]\n\nCAPTAIN: I have the honor to report that in obedience to orders from Brigadier General Thomas A. Davies, commanding district of Rolla, Mo., I left that point with the detachment under my command, consisting of 29 men of the First Nebraska Cavalry and 32 men of the Eleventh Cavalry, Missouri Volunteers, on the 17th day of January, 1864, for Batesville, Ark., with orders to report to you on my arrival. The route pursued by me was via Salem, Spring Valley, Jack's Fork, Thomasville, and Evening Shade; distance, 210 miles. Forage scarce at Thomasville.\n\nI unexpectedly encountered Colonel M. Johnson, in command of a detachment of Confederate troops, escorting his family and that of Captain Andrews, of Freeman's command, northward, with the intention, as I afterward learned, of taking them to the neighborhood of Rolla, Mo. On my approach the escort fled, leaving in my hands as prisoners the entire train of 3 wagons, 11 mules, 3 horses, together with the entire property, among which were 2 bales of cotton. After leaving Thomasville, and at the crossing of the Arkansas line, I again encountered the enemy, and for nearly 40 miles kept up a continual skirmish with his forces. I captured 5 prisoners besides the ladies belonging to Colonel Johnson's family. I am grateful too be able to state that no casualties occurred on our side.\n\nThe loss of the enemy I am unable to ascertain, from the fact that, from their knowledge of the country and its bearings, they could at any moment elude any pursuit by me.\n\nIn this connection I desire to express my thanks to Sergeant Harvey and the men of the First Nebraska Cavalry for the cheerful manner with which all orders given by me were obeyed. Often in the advance, their truly arduous duties were performed with that readiness and alacrity which will always characterize the true soldier. The property taken by me will immediately be turned over by my acting quartermaster to the provost-marshal for his action in regard to its disposal. My thanks are also due to Lieutenant Ambrose Gallagher, Company D, Eleventh Missouri Cavalry, commanding escort, and Lieutenant Otto Schweikher, Company H, Eleventh Missouri Cavalry, acting quartermaster, for the able assistance rendered me on the journey.\n\nI have the honor to be, yours, respectfully,\n\nJOHN W. STEPHENS,\n\nLieutenant-Colonel, Commanding Detachment."

He staid at my informant's house, and his object was to send in the flag of truce. General Taylor is at Alexandria and has not been to New Iberia. There are 10,000 men, who can be increased to 16,000 in a few days. He says that there is a raft 3 miles long now, which will be 10 miles long when the river rises, commanded by Fort De Russy. There are about 250 cavalry in New Iberia. I think that there is no present danger here, but will report more fully to-morrow. I arrived here this morning.\n\nW. B.

HALLECK,\n\nCommander-in-Chief, &c.:\n\nGENERAL: Your dispatches of the 4th and the 11th January are received, the first on the 13th instant and the second by the mail to-day. I am much gratified to know that General Sherman is instructed to co-operate with the commands on the Mississippi. With the forces you propose, I concur in your opinion,and with Generals Sherman and Steele, \"that the Red River is the shortest and best line of defense for Louisiana and Arkansas, and as a base of operations against Texas,\" but it would be too much for General Steele or myself to undertake separately. With our united forces and the assistance of General Sherman the success of movements on that line will be certain and important. I shall most cordially co-operate with them in executing your orders.\n\nWith my own command I can operate with safety, only on the coast of Texas, but from the coast I could not penetrate far into the interior, nor secure control of more than the country west of San Antonio. On the other line, with commensurate forces, the whole State as well as Arkansas and Louisiana, will be ours, and their people will gladly renew their allegiance to the Government. The occupation of Shreveport will be to the country west of the Mississippi what that of Chattanooga is to the east, and as soon as this can be accomplished the country west of Shreveport will be in condition for movement into Texas. I have written to General Sherman and General Steele, in accordance with these views, and shall be ready to act with them as soon as the Atchafalaya and Red River will admit the navigation of our gun-boats. Our supplies can be transported by the Red River until April at least. In the mean time the railway from Vicksburg to Shreveport ought to be completed, which would furnish communication very comfortably for the whole of Eastern Texas. I do not mean that operations should be deferred of this purpose, but as an ultimate advantage in the occupation of these States and the establishment of governments it would be of great importance.\n\nI inclose to you with this communication a very complete map* of the Red River country and Texas, which embraces all the information we have been able to obtain up to this time. It has been prepared by Major D. C. Houston, of the engineer corps, and will show that we have not overlooked the importance of this line. Accompanying the map is a memoir, which exhibits the difficulties that are to be overcome. To this I respectfully ask your attention. I have sent to General Sherman and General Steele copies of this map. I shall be ready to move to Alexandria as soon as the rivers are up, most probably marching by Opelousas. This will be necessary to turn the forts on Red River and open the way for the gun-boats. From that point I can operate with General Steele north or south of Red River, in the direction of Shreveport, and from thence await your instructions. I do not think operations will be delayed on my account. I have received a dispatch from General Sherman, in which he expresses a wish to enter upon this campaign, but had not at that time received orders upon the subject.\n\nI do not think it expedition to give up the occupation of Matagorda Bay, which is a key point of Texas, and may be of great service hereafter in communication with the coast from the interior, but the force will be reduced to the lowest number consistent with the safe occupation of Matagorda Island. I have a small force east of Lake Pontchartian, sent over to cover an effort, to obtain lumber and other quartermaster's stores, and which will be withdrawn as soon as we have active field duty. I can concentrate on Red River all my force available for active service except the garrisons at Matagorda and Brownsville, which will be small. I am very much gratified by the report of re-enforcements to which your dispatches refer.\n\nWith great respect,&c.,\n\nN. P. BANKS,\n\nMajor-General, Commanding."

C.:\n\nGENERAL: I am gratified to be able to state that nearly the entire force of the Nineteenth Army Corps has re-enlisted for the war. A considerable portion of the Thirteenth Corps has also re-enlisted, and all would have been obtained, except for the orders received from the War Department in regard to the suspension of bounties. We have since received information that the bounties are renewed, and I am quite confident that a greater part, if not all, of these two corps will re-enlist. The spirit of the troops is admirable. The will considerably reduce my command, but a sufficient force will be left for the operations referred to in the accompanying dispatch,*\n\nwhich we shall commence as soon as the navigation permits.\n\nI cannot but express my great gratification at the report which you make of re-enforcements for this department, which I hope may be sufficient to compensate for the loss by furloughs. I have received a communication from General Sherman in regard to the stoppage of our forage on the river, and hope that all difficulties in this respect will be removed. The political indications in this State are satisfactory. I entertain no doubt that a full vote will be given in the election of the 22nd of February, and that the State officers, with a full delegation in both Houses of Congress, composed of earnest and intelligent supporters of the Administration and disposed to co-operate with the military forces of the department, will be ready for service by the middle of April.\n\nThere is great unanimity of feeling with the people in this State as to election. No serious objection is made except on the part of persons whose private plans have been somewhat disturbed by the immediate organization of a State government. Let me assure you that attention to questions relating to the Government will not interfere with a preparation for military movements.\n\nI have the honor to be, with much respect your obedient servant,\n\nN.

If there is plenty of forage at Berryville and Rolling Prairie, I think the troops operating in Arkansas, after sufficiently scouting Searcy and Newton Counties, had better be brought back to these places, with perhaps a part on White River in the vicinity of Bufallo. Not less than seven or eight squadrons should be left on Rolling Prairie, if any. If the river continues fordable and there are no new developments, I think now that I will send seven squadrons of the Sixth Provisional Regiment to Rolling Prairie in a few days. You may send this to General Holland when you send forward dispatches. Phelps had better move up from Berryville. Have General Holland move far so from Berryville [sic].\n\nJOHN B.

Probably the matter will be made the subject of a communication to Lord Lyons. In one of your former dispatches, you spoke of fitting out an expedition in the spring against the Indians in the Territories of Dakota and Idaho. I think it would be well for you to submit your plans more fully, in order that they may be laid before the President and Secretary of War, and the proper instructions given to the heads of the bureaus for supplies, &c.\n\nPlease state what troops you propose to send into the Indian country, what supplies that cannot be obtained in your department you will require, where they should be sent, at what time, &c. I presume it will be necessary to collect at least a part of them during the winter. As you may wish to wait for further developments before deciding definitely upon your plans, I do not aks for an immediate reply. Keep the subject in mind and give us as early and full information as you can. As the demands of the principal armies in the field for re-enforcement are very pressing, these proposed Indian expeditions should be made as small as possible.\n\nVery respectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nH.

This company is under the command of Lieutenant Ridgway and has been stationed at Sibley.\n\nR. C. VAUGHAN,\n\nBrigadier-General, Enrolled Missouri Militia.\n\nI immediately telegraphed Colonel McFerran at Warrensburg and Captain Meredith at Lexington to send a military force sufficient to arrest the parties, if possible and send them to these headquarters. Colonel McFerran telegraphs me that Ridgway was in Greenton Valley yesterday carrying on his depredations. If my troops fail in arresting him, I respectfully ask that he be ordered under arrest and sent to these headquarters. If a collision is brought on between and sent to these headquarters. If a collision is brought on between the Kansas and Missouri troops it will not be my fault, but it is time that an end was put to their robberies under the cloak of freeing negroes. If Kansas wants negroes I will send 500 women and children to that State in two days, as they are a great annoyance to me, and everybody want them removed. But they do not want them; they want the property the negroes carry off and the opportunity of taking it by coming into the State.\n\nI am, very truly, your obedient servant,\n\nE. B.

I need not say that it will afford me the highest pleasure to operate with you if this plan shall be adopted. Movements upon the line of the Red River furnish the most effective means for the defense of Louisiana and Arkansas and also for offensive operations against Texas. But it is impossible for me, with my limited command, safely to undertake such an enterprise, and I suppose, from what I know of your command, that it would be equally unsafe for you. The concentration of the troops in Louisiana and Arkansas, with re-enforcements from the east bank of the river under Major General W. T. Sherman, which is indicated as possible, would furnish a force that would enable us to occupy this country and enter upon the campaign in Texas, which would give us an immediate control of that State. I am fully satisfied that the three States are ready for a return to the Union if such forces shall occupy them as will protect the inhabitants in returning to their allegiance.\n\nCaptain Robert T. Dunham bears this dispatch to you. He knows the position of affairs in this State, and I desire that you will communicate to him for my use, as far as you think proper, a statement of your position and the concentration of forces that may be possible in the event of such a movement as this I have suggested being ordered by the Department of War. I shall endeavor to keep you advised of all occurrences in this department, and hope to receive information from you as often as it may be convenient.\n\nWith the highest respect, I remain, your obedient servant,\n\nN. P. BANKS,\n\nMajor-General, Commanding."

B SCATES,\n\nAssistant Adjutant-General, Thirteenth Army Corps:\n\nLIEUTENANT-COLONEL: Since my last report nothing new has transpired; everything right so far as I can judge. The bastions are completed and guns, under the efficient charge of Captain Thompson, of Company C, Twentieth Iowa (who with his company were detailed by me to take charge of the guns), are now all in proper position. The men we drilled daily at the guns and have made excellent progress, and the practice at the distance of 1 1\\2 miles is certainly as good as the average. The guns have all been thoroughly cleaned and varnished, and are kept in complete order. The magazines are completed and the ammunition stored in the same. I have company drill every a. m. and battalion drill every p. m., to which both men and officers have given prompt attention, and as the acting inspector-general has just compelled his work of inspection and will report officially to you, I need not now remark as to the proficiency in drill, &c., of the troops, all of which will be reported to you officially.\n\nI do not wish to be considered importunate, but let me once more say to you, my men ae destitute of clothing, and that, too, in its literal sense. Tents we can get along without, so long as we remain here, as barracks have been put up by me since I came here, which are comfortable, but clothing we must have, and I do most earnestly request that supplies be forwarded to us as soon as possible. No paymaster has as yet been here, consequently we have not been paid. But clothing is what we want. Provisions are plenty and a sufficient supply is now on hand to last until the 1st of March, and may be longer, as commissary stores are now being discharge from the steamer Clinton, the amount of which I cannot ascertain for this report, but I shall the first opportunity send full report.\n\nRespectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nWM. G. THOMPSON,\n\nMajor, Commanding Post of Aransas.\n\nP. S.-I am informed by the post quartermaster that he has sufficient provisions for the post (500 men) for ninety days from this date."

He must be prepared for this. Should there be reason to apprehend attack from the enemy's gun-boats, the approaches, by water should be swept by artillery, and submarine obstructions and destructive arranged.\n\nThe commanding general wishes Major-General Dana to understand that he does not for the present contemplate assuming the offensive from the positions now occupied by General Dana, and that it may be necessary to withdraw a portion of the forces now there for operations elsewhere. For this reason the means of transportation called for are not now forwarded. The men now here belonging to regiments there may remain here until it shall be decided which regiments will remain with General Dana. A pile-driver and piles, small-boats, seines, and supplies of forage and lumber clothing, camp and garrison equipage, and other necessaries will be sent to General Dana; also artisans and materials for the repair of the steamer Warrior. Cavalry will be sent as soon as the means of transportation admit.\n\nVery respectfully, I am, general your obedient servant,\n\nCHAS. P. STONE,\n\nBrigadier-General, Chief of Staff."

STONE, Chief of Staff:\n\nGENERAL: After three weeks' trial, I am satisfied that our line of communication via Point Isabel is not the correct one under existing circumstances. The steamers carrying supplies to this post are of such a draught that they cannot get nearer than 5 miles to Point Isabel, where they anchor and transfer the charge to river boats to be carried to the point.\n\nThese smaller boats approach to within 50 feet of shore, a wharf having been constructed that length. From here goods are carried by wagons to Brownsville, it requiring two days to make the trip each way, and water being found at only one point on the route. Water is also carried back by these teams for men as well as animals at Point Isabel.\n\nWhat I propose to do is to build a wharf at Brazos Island and establish the depots there, bridge Boca Chica, and transport all supplies by wagons along the beach to the mouth of the Rio Grande, and shipping there on rive boats for Brownsville. If is 9 miles from the wharf at Brazos Island to the mouth of the river, the road along the beach hard an in fine condition. For a few days each month this road might be impassable, but I propose to construct another road inside of the sand hills that will be protected in all water. By this route we shall have but 9 miles of land transportation and can unload much more rapidly than by the present way. The garrison at Point Isabel, will, of course, be contained, but a portion of the Sixteenth Corps d'Afrique will be moved to the mouth of the river as a guard, and to handle stores. I inclose a sketch that will give you an idea of the new route.\n\nVery respectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nF. J. HERRON,\n\nMajor-General, Commanding.\n\nThe sketch was not ready; will send it by next mail."

          "text": "BATESVILLE, ARK., January 24, 1864\n\nCaptain H. C. FILLEBROWN,\n\nAsst. Adjt. General, District of Northeastern Arkansas:\n\nCAPTAIN: In accordance with Special Orders, Numbers 13, headquarters District Northeastern Arkansas, dated January 16, 1864, and letter of instructions of same date, I left Batesville about daylight the 17th, in command of the First Battalion, First Cavalry, Nebraska Volunteers, consisting of 150 men and 5 commissioned officers, moving directly to Powhatan, the crossing of Black River, passing in the route Smithville, and ferried my command over by 11 p.m.; distance, 45 miles. I here fed. At daybreak was on the move down the river in the direction of Jacksonport. The result of the first 3 miles march was the killing of 1 man named Grissome, a bushwhacker, the capture of 1 sergeant, having several letters and official documents from General Price, Colonel Shelby, and others of no particular importance, and 2 privates, Confederate soldiers, horses, equipments, and arms. Three miles from this point we were met by 6 Confederate soldiers belonging to Captain McVeigh's company; captured 3 and pressed the others so closely that they deserted their horses, thereby leaving them in our hands.\n\nHearing that at or opposite a place below on Black River, called Bird's Point (distance, 24 miles), there was a company of 20, I moved forward as fast as possible without meeting or seeing anything worthy of note. Upon arriving near this point I ascertained that there was a party of about that number a scattered around at houses off the main road. I immediately disposed of my command so as to surround all the houses in that neighborhood, the result of which was the capture of Colonel Brand, Captain Edwards, Captain McVeigh, Captain Webb, Lieutenant Smith, Lieutenant Wylie and 12 men, C. S. Army, with their horses and arms, except those of the officers, which they managed to secrete so effectively that it was impossible for me to find them. By this time it was getting dark. I then moved forward 5 miles to a point on Black River called Elgin, and fed. After feeding at this point I allowed my men to lie down and rest until 3 o'clock, at which time I had them in line ready to move. At this mounted I received a dispatch from Colonel Livingston, by a courier from Captain Kauffman, stating that he (Colonel Livingston) had sent me 150 men under Captain Kauffman, as re-enforcements; also that General McRae occupied Jacksonport with 250 men.\n\nI at once sent a messenger to Captain Kauffman to hurry up with all possible dispatch, at the same time sending one squadron under Lieutenant Murphy, Company F, First Nebraska Cavalry, with instructions to go 1 1/2 miles in advance and occupy with his command all the roads, place a guard around all the houses he passed sufficient to keep any person from getting out to give information of our presence and ascertain the exact force in Jacksonport and report to me by courier as soon as he had accomplished his mission. I then ordered my men to dismount and get their breakfast. The information thus obtained was to the effect that Jacksonport was only occupied by some 30 men under Captain Siddell, C. S. [Army]. At 12 m. my messenger returned from Captain Kauffman, stating that he was near at hand.\n\nFeeling that I had a sufficient force to move into Jacksonport, I did not wait for Captain Kauffman, fearing that by some means they (the enemy) might perhaps get information of our presence and leave. Moving up with as much celerity and caution as I possibly could to within 2 miles of the town, where the roads forked, I divided my command, sending three squadrons under the command of Captain Curran to the right, down Black River (one, however, was guarding provisions, which I ordered him to leave a half mile behind before charging into town). With the other two I moved down below, to cut off their retreat in case they got sight of him first. After arriving at a certain point, at a certain time a signal was to be given by me (the firing of a pistol), upon which the whole command was to dash into town, which done, the result was the killing of Captain Eckells, 5 Confederate soldiers, and the capture of Captain Siddell, Lieutenants Washburn, Owen, Bell, and 16 men, C. S. Army, all their horses, horse equipments and some arms, they managing mostly to throw their arms away. There being snow on the ground it was impossible for us to find them.\n\nAt this time the detachment of the Eleventh Missouri, under Captain Kauffman, came in. I ascertained from some of the prisoners captured that Major Snider, C. S. Army, with from 60 to 80 men, was encamped about 8 miles from in the Conditt settlement. I at once placed my prisoners in the most suitable building, leaving as a guard Company A, First Cavalry, Nebraska Volunteers, numbering 32 men, and ordered Captain Kauffman with his command down White River to the crossing of Village Creek used in the morning by them (the means of crossing being only a small raft, the stream unfordable), with instructions to follow up their trail, which could easily be discerned on account of the snow. I then moved out in the direction of the camp with my battalion for the purpose of attacking them, but before reaching that point I got information to the effect that they had notice of our presence and were moving down to the crossing of Village Creek, then occupied by Captain Kauffman.\n\nMoving as rapidly as possible by the shortest route to the road they were on, I struck it just fifteen minutes behind them. Shortly after firing was heard in the front, supposed by me to be the Eleventh Missouri attacking their advance, which was correct. Urging my horses up to full speed, I shortly encountered them, at the same gait, on their retreat from Captain Kauffman..\n\nUpon their discovery of my command they or their advance (they having changed front so suddenly that their rear might properly [be] called their advance) fired one volley. Returning the fire I charged them, they scattering in every direction. At this point my horse was so frenzied with excitement that he became altogether ungovernable carrying me to the left and entirely away from my command into a party of the retreating foe numbering from 15 to 20. Feeling that my own personal safety depended altogether on my own action, I shot 3, which so terrified the rest that several that I heard sangout, \"I surrender.\" I managed to throw myself off my horse and make my way back to the command, a distance of over 1 mile, after which I sent my men in every direction scouring the woods and swamps thoroughly. The result of this attack was the Eleventh Missouri, under Kauffman, killing 2 capturing 3, with their horses and arms; my command killing 3, capturing 3, 1 being mortally and 1 slightly wounded.\n\nI then moved my command back to Jacksonport, arriving at that point at daylight (the 20th). Upon my arrival I was informed that by the use of a pocket knife the prisoners had cut a hole in the floor sufficiently large to crawl through. By this means Colonel Brand, Captain Edwards, Captain McVeigh, Captain Webb, Captain Siddell, Captain ---, Lieutenant Smith, Wylie, Washburn, Owen, Bell, 1 sergeant, and 10 Confederate soldiers had effected their escape, the rest of the prisoners at that time being asleep. I at once ordered my command out in every direction to, if possible, recapture them, but failed after a vigilant search until 4 p.m. 20th. Upon the return of my scouting parties, I ordered Captain Kauffman to at once cross Black River, taking with him all the prisoners then in my possession, and report to Batesville, which he did, arriving at that point at 4 a.m., 21st, turning prisoners, horses, and arms over to Captain Allen, provost-marshal.\n\nPursuant to previous instructions, I remained with my command at Jacksonport for the protection of a boat expected up the river with supplies for Batesville. The boat did not arrive until after dark on the night of the 21st, and anchored in the stream opposite town. At daylight on the morning of the 22nd, she moved up the river and I crossed my command over Black River. By the time I was across she came back, reporting that it was impossible for he to move up the river for the reason that she was then drawing 5 1/2 feet water, and there was not that amount in the channel above the point where Black emptied into White River, consequently Major W. ordered her to lighten up to 3 feet, by unloading, a portion of her load, and try it again.\n\nThe commissary stores unloaded I left to be guarded by four squadrons under Captain Curran, on this side of Black River, a distance from this point of 25 miles. Feeling that the stores were perfectly secure under charge of Captain Curran, with four squadrons First Nebraska Cavalry, and that my presence was not needed, I took one squadron and came through, leaving at 1 p.m., 22nd, and arriving at this place at 10 p.m. same evening. The whole distance marched by my command was about 150 miles.\n\nThe accompanying diagram* will show more perfectly the route traveled by me than I could possibly explain in writing. The result of the whole expedition was following: Killed of the enemy, 1 captain, 15 men; wounded, 2, 1 mortally, 1 slightly; capture of 1 colonel, 4 captains, 5 lieutenants, 1 sergeant, and 40 men, belonging to various commands of the C. S. Army. My command escaped, fortunately, without the loss or injury of a single man. I regret exceedingly that such ill fate should befall me as the loss of the officers and men before enumerated by escaping. It was the most mortifying thing that ever happened me in my military life. The officers and soldiers of my command endured the fatigues and hardships of the expedition as should all good soldiers, with activity and cheerfulness, always ready and ever anxious to engage the enemy, regardless of numbers.\n\nThe whole expedition was conducted with so much secrecy that the inhabitants of the country through which I passed were taken completely by surprise. The moral effect upon them surpassed even my most sanguine expectations. The prevalent opinion now is that the Confederates are not safe anywhere within the limits of this district. The effect upon the enemy is demoralizing in the extreme; they are losing all heart. Their leaders can no longer buoy them up with the false hope of success, and they are in many instances themselves watching a favorable opportunity to return to their allegiance.\n\nI am, captain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nTHOMAS J. MAJORS,\n\nCaptain, Commanding Expedition."

OF THE NORTHWEST,\nSaint Paul, Minn., April 9, 1864.\n\nMajor General JOHN POPE,\n\nMilwaukee:\n\nGENERAL: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your dispatch of 4th instant. Your order prohibiting the departure of the Sixth Regiment Minnesota Volunteers until orders to the contrary are sent me from department headquarters will be complied with, and the detachments of that regiment now stationed along the outer defenses of the frontier will be directed to hold themselves in readiness to move as soon as marching orders reach them.\n\nI cannot but believe that the latter part of your dispatch is based upon a misapprehension of the force in this district. Leaving the Sixth Regiment out of the estimate, I have under my command the Eighth Regiment Minnesota Volunteer Infantry, numbering about 800 effective men; the Second Minnesota Cavalry, about 1,050 men; Hatch's battalion, about 350 men; the Third Minnesota Battery, about 125 men; and the Invalid or Veteran Reserve Corps, numbering about 150. The first-named regiment (to be mounted), with eight companies Second Cavalry and two sections of the battery, say, 1500 men, or perhaps 1,600, are to be dispatched in accordance with your directions to join General Sully. I shall then be left without any infantry force to establish the two posts in the interior, and the rest of the military strength specified will be barely sufficient to garrison the posts already in existence and guard the frontier against hostile raids. Brackett's battalion is, of course, not embraced in the foregoing enumeration, it being under marching orders for Sioux City. Forts Abercrombie, Ripley, and Ridgely should not be garrisoned by less than two companies each, and the Veteran Reserve detachment will be required at Fort Snelling.\n\nThere are some exposed stations along the extensive line which should be occupied by small detachments, and to effect all these objects you will perceive I shall be left with a force all told of not more than one regiment of men. To enable me to carry out your plan for the establishment of the posts on James River and Devil's Lake the First Regiment should be ordered on duty in this district without delay. Its three years' term of service expires on 29th instant, when many of the veterans will be mustered out, leaving between 300 and 400, including recruits. The ranks can, I think, be filled up to the minimum, at least in time to enable me to dispatch a force sufficient for the two posts.\n\nI am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nH. H. SIBLEY,\n\nBrigadier-General, Commanding.\n\nN. B.-I did not advert to another fact, as I perhaps should have done, and that is the necessity of having some disposable force on hand to enforce the draft. It is Governor Miller's belief, as well as my own, that in some localities in this State there will be resistance unless there is a military force on hand to compel submission.\n\nRespectfully,\n\nH. H. SIBLEY,\n\nBrigadier-General, Commanding."

As full meteorological observations should be made as opportunity and the means at your disposal render practicable. I need not remind you of the important results to science which will ensue from ever a partial success in these observations.\n\nGeneral Sully has been furnished with a copy of this letter, and will give you all the assistance at his command in carrying out these instructions as far as circumstances will permit. I have myself made very complete collections, both of natural history and botanical and mineralogical specimens, by instructing 2 or 3 enlisted men how to make them, and keeping them constantly employed. I need not suggest to you that it is best to bring in specimens of everything, however common, as it is of as much, if indeed not of more interest to science to determine the geographical distributions of known species than to discover what is new.\n\nThe ordinary extra pay will be given to enlisted men employed by you in this service.\n\nI am, captain, respectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nJNO.

FORD,\n\nCommanding Fourth Sub-District, Kansas City, Mo.:\n\nSIR: I arrived here this morning from off Grand River to get some horses shod. I scouted on the Missouri River two days and found no sign of bushwhackers or boats. We looked at every foot of the river bank from the month of Little Blue to La Fayette line. We then went south on the west line of this district to Grand River, then up both sides of the Grand to Dayton, where we struck the trail of some Company L men, who were stationed at Dayton. We leave this day at noon for Grand River, taking a southwest course through Grand and its branches. Our horses are getting pretty thin, and will need some time to recruit when we get in. I hear of 2 men that were sent up to you. I hope you will keep them for us to escort to Warrensburg or somewhere else. I am happy to inform you that we have not come onto a bushwhacker trail since we started, nor heard of one, and we have scoured the country where we went well. Have followed up many trails, but they come out all right when followed up.\n\nTrusting the above will meet with your approbation, I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nB. F.

Several skirmishes have taken place since you left, the country being full of guerrillas. Fitzwilliams, with his band of accomplished cut-throats, has been in close proximity with this place for a number of days past. He attacked our train several times between here and Rosewille, but could not effect anything. The organization of the militia will render available service and co-operate very advantageously with the present military forces in this district at present. I inclose you copy of General Orders, Numbers 4. We are pleased to learn that our worthy Governor indorsed its organization. Do what you can for me, judge. I will forward some credentials from commissioned officers in a few days.\n\nVery respectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nCHAS. C. REID."

M., Commanding 3rd Sub-Dist., Warrensburg, Mo.:\n\nCOLONEL: I have the honor to report to you that the men under my command have been on nine scouts within the last ten days, and have traveled in the aggregate 1,440 miles, being equal to 17 30/77 miles' travel to each man. We find the country all quiet and the people generally at work with all their force preparing for their spring crops. We have neither seen nor heard of any bushwhackers on the contrary find the people generally well disposed toward the Government and desirous to submit to all military orders. We find forage rather scarce in the country, but up to the present we have been able to get full rations for our horses.\n\nI am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nJAMES D.

ROSECRANS,\nCommanding Department of the Missouri:\n\nSIR: Excuse my neglect of the matter of your communication by telegraph dated the 12th. The pressure of immediate duties has prevented earlier attention. I inclose a copy of General Hurlbut's letter of instructions (A); also copy of my order issued thereon, Numbers 15 (B); also copy of General Hurlbut's supplemental letter (C); also copy of my supplemental Orders, Numbers 21 (D); also my Orders, Numbers 16 (E) on a kindred subject; also my letter of April 2, showing the necessity of these orders (F).* That necessity has been tenfold more apparent since the orders were issued than before. You will notice that my order goes somewhat beyond the letter of instructions and contains matter for which General Hurlbut is not primarily responsible, the responsibility being with me. Being on the spot, being well advised, and time being important, I acted. I am satisfied that I was right, and as well satisfied that the measure does far as Missouri is concerned, if you desire it.\n\nThe reading of my letter (F) will explain so fully that I need not again say how fatal to us has been the unwarrantable freedom accorded to the landing of goods in places convenient for their passing into the enemy's hands. As soon as I can get communications past Fort Pillow, I will advise General Hurlbut of your dispatch and of this, my explanation. The Missouri side of the river is under the shadow of this post and I frequently find it necessary to visit that side to break up illicit trade, to control crossings, and to do other things concerning the safety of navigation, &c., but I respectfully disclaim any desire to do any act on that side which you would not at once request and authorize, were you near and personally cognizant of the facts. On the other hand, I shall take pleasure in responding to your wishes.\n\nI will make another communication on a subject connected with your command below.\n\nRespectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nM. BRAYMAN,\n\nBrigadier-General, Commanding."

Mex.:\n\nGENERAL: Your letter of March 20 is received,* and so much of it as refers to quartermaster and commissary business will be referred to the chiefs of those bureaus for their action, which will be duly communicated. It was not supposed that, with the means at your disposal, you would be able to move far into Texas, but it was hoped that some demonstration might be made on the upper Rio Grande which would at least embarrass the rebels in that quarter. Any troops sent out for this object should not be advanced so far to be seriously exposed.\n\nSince my last letter to you on this subject General Banks seems to have changed his base of operations from the Gulf, west to the Red River. This will probably render any demonstration on your part of less assistance to him than when he was operating on his former base. Indeed, I am of opinion that after his long delays he will not accomplish much in Texas this spring. On the 1st of February last Brigadier General J. R. West was ordered to report for duty to Major-General Steele, Department of Arkansas. It appears from your recent dispatches that you had not received the order. If so, this will be sufficient authority for you to send him to General Steele. In anything you may do on Mexican territory, be exceedingly careful to give no offense to the French. It is important at the present time that we maintain the most amicable relations with that power.\n\nVery respectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nH. W. HALLECK,\n\nChief of Staff."

FISK,\n\nCommanding District of North Missouri, Saint Joseph, Mo.:\n\nGENERAL: There has been for about two months a detachment of 10 men of the Ninth Missouri State Militia Cavalry at our town, sent there as a guard to the assistant provost-marshal appointed for the enlistment of negroes in our county. The appointment of the assistant provost-marshal of this county has been vacated by special order from office of provost-marshal-general. Since his removal some 6 or 7 recruits have come in, and were escorted to the office of district provost-marshal by the sergeant commanding detachment, and I have no doubt that other recruits will be coming in from time to time, provided there is any one here to receive them. I am here on duty as deputy provost-marshal under the conscription act of Congress, and have been since August, 1863, and have frequently need for a guard in the execution of orders for the arrest of deserters, &c.\n\nThere are no troops nearer us than Mexico, and I should be very glad if you would signify a willingness for this detachment to remain here. They are a very quiet and orderly squad, and I believe their presence is beneficial to our community, which is, as you are perhaps aware, about nine-tenths secessionists, and is likewise a great harboring place for returned rebels, horse thieves, and other criminals. I shall further take the liberty of stating to you that under General Schofield's General Orders, Numbers 86, arms were returned or distributed to all in our county without any regard to present or former status, and there is not a man in Monroe County, no matter how vile a rebel he has been, or is still, but what has or can have any arms he may choose. I repeat again that there is no restriction placed upon any man in Monroe County in regard to carrying fire-arms. There are hundreds of young men, most of whom were directly or indirectly connected with the rebellion, whom are now carrying revolvers under their coats. Some of them have permits from General Schofield both to carry arms and buy ammunition when and where they choose.\n\nWill these permits be good under General Rosecrans' general orders regulating sale of arms and ammunition? They think they will and intend to act accordingly. Now, it does seem to me that (and it is the feeling of all the Union men of the county) there should be some distinction between men who have been rebels so long as they could safely be and those who were friends of the Government through all our troubles. We believed Schofield's order contemplated that there should be. But such is not the case, and all are treated alike in this respect. I only allude to this thing because I think it my duty as an officer of the U. S. Government to do so, but my duties as deputy provost-marshal do not require me to take official notice of them; but do hope the time will come when traitors shall cease to be entitled to all the privileges allowed loyal men, and our loyal people hope so, and God grant we may not be disappointed. The squad of the Missouri State Militia is now here, and have subsistence for balance of present month. Should you think the good of the service would be promoted by their continuation at this place please let me hear from you at your earliest convenience.\n\nI am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nW. E. FOWKES,\n\nDeputy Provost-Marshal, Monroe County."

Your directions concerning the forwarding of supplies have been and are being complied with as fast as possible. Upon consultation with General Kimball it was thought best to start the train from Pine Bluff, and rendered almost imperatively so from the fact that Captain Cantine reported large amounts of stores, such as were ordered, had been shipped to Pine Bluff in anticipation of that place being made your base of supplies, and that there was not a sufficient amount of stores at Little Rock to load the teams as required. I gave Captain Manly orders to take from the transportation at this place all that he required, and directed him to decide what amount should remain behind. He reported at 12 o'clock yesterday that his entire train, consisting of 123 wagons, was on the road to Pine Bluff.\n\nThe steamer Chippewa is loaded with quartermaster's stores and ammunition, and left for Pine Bluff at-to-day and will reach that place some time to-morrow morning. The wagon train will arrive to-morrow night and will begin to load immediately. The wagons should all be loaded and on the road at 12 o'clock on the 14th. Lieutenant-Colonel Mackey, of the Thirty-third Iowa, is in command of the escort, consisting of something over 600 men belonging to the regiments of General Salomon's division (left behind, and that have arrived since the troops left), and about 250 dismounted cavalry belonging to regiment to regiments in General Carr's division. Colonel Clayton is ordered to furnish from 100 to 200 cavalry to accompany Colonel Mackey; also to turn over to the train every wagon he can possibly spare, and if necessary to press teams from the country in the vicinity of Pine Bluff. I have done and will do everything I possibly can to hurry the supplies forward.\n\nVery respectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nW. D. GREEN,\n\nAssistant Adjutant-General."

The rebels wish to stop and prevent planting in West Kentucky and Tennessee. The intention of the rebels in Northern Arkansas, and of the guerrillas, with a powerful armed secret organization here, is to do the same in Missouri, and the time of the advent of their operations is at hand, for which reason no move of troops from the interior to increase the feelings of insecurity here should, if possible, be made until planting is over. Please, if you approve, send orders at once about using the Ninth Iowa and Seventeenth Illinois Cavalry,and as to the dismounted cavalry form the depot.\n\nW. S. ROSECRANS,\n\nMajor-General."

The provost-marshal needs a mounted police to assist him in his business, and I have information that with a sufficient cavalry force quite a number of important seizures might be made. There are also several parties of Confederates in the vicinity, on near Indian village, of about 30 men, under command of Lieutenant Hack. With a company of cavalry these parties might be either driven off or captured.\n\nHoping that you will take this matter into consideration I remain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nRICHARD G. SHAW,\n\nMajor 14th Rhode Island Heavy Arty. (Colored), Commanding Post."

He directs that you bring with you from Pass Cavallo all the troops now at that point that in your judgment are not absolutely necessary in connection with the gun-boats to defend the place. He considers it almost certain that the greater portion of Magruder's force will be withdrawn from Galveston and brought here. he considers that one or two regiments of white infantry, in connection with a regiment of the Corps d;'Afrique, which has been ordered to Pass Cavallo, will be sufficient to protect the place. He, however, leaves it discretionary with you, after a full consideration of the affairs in your front, to decide as to the number of troops that shall be withdrawn. It is desirable that every means be used by you to reach this point at the earliest possible moment. You will come here by way of New Orleans and Red River. The quartermaster's department has been instructed to facilitate this movement by all the means at its disposal.\n\nI have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nGEO. B.

You have done well in capturing 24. You will do better by killing or capturing the rest. I have ordered Colonel Fuller to send you some force from Dardanelle; 100 resolute, energetic officers and men on the side of right ought to kill and capture all the scoundrels around you. I hope you will do it. I have no force here to re-enforce you. Seize and impress horses belonging to rebels and their sympathizers, and drive every disloyal man out of the country. Hang or shoot every devil who robs and murders citizens or destroyers the telegraph. Take good care of the loyal and the women and children. Don't burn any houses nor destroy other property. Destroy the scoundrels, and the property will hurt no one.\n\nNATHAN KIMBALL,\n\nBrigadier-General, Commanding."

I am not acquainted with the position of defense at Patterson, and therefore telegraphed on receipt of your first dispatch to Major Wilson, commanding at Patterson, for advice. Major Willson sent written instructions which I somehow did not receive. Telegraphed to him again this morning on receipt of you second dispatch. Am awaiting an answer. Will inform you as soon as Major Wilson answer.\n\nAdvised all the outposts in regard to Kitchen and Clark's force gathering. Entertain no fear; they are on the lookout. Major Wilson has four good companies; will fight four times their number and whip them. Can re-enforce them in two hours from here. The company at Centreville should not be taken away from there; it is a most important point, an opening for the rebels to come in. Do not be alarmed; I think it is no more than a scare, to which we down here are used. Major Wilson thinks the howitzers could be used to advantage in case of an attack.\n\nJOHN N.

CANBY,\n\nCommanding Division of West Mississippi:\n\nGENERAL: As I have already written you, on the 1st instant I sent out an expedition in pursuit of Forrest, under command of General Sturgis. This stripped me of nearly all my mounted force, but this morning part of the Seventh Kansas Cavalry has arrived, and I shall send out to-morrow a reconnoitering party into Arkansas, consisting of about 400 cavalry. I do this because General Steele has expressed the fear that Shelby, with 1,500 mounted men, had crossed the Arkansas and White Rivers, and was pushing for Missouri. Steele thinks they would go up Crowley's Ridge.\n\nI shall send a boat to-night, with 300 infantry from here and one section of artillery, to proceed up the Saint Francis River; the boat will be used to ferry the cavalry across the Saint Francis, and will remain with the infantry until the cavalry shall return. Should I get information that General Steele's suspicions are well founded I will organize all the cavalry I can and send in pursuit of Shelby. I have reason to hope that in one week I shall receive 1,000 more horses, and, if so, that will enable me to send 1,500 west of the Mississippi. The cavalry sent with Sturgis will be absent twenty days.\n\nI am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nC. C. WASHBURN,\n\nMajor-General."

At same time Major Houts sent scout of 25 men from Marshall, co-operating with Box. On 23rd Captain Ballew made a four days' scout with 50 men through Grand Pass to Waverly, thence south to Davis and through Freedomtown, thence through Dunksburg toward Boonville and to Sedalia. Captain Turley from 20th to 23rd was scouting from Grand Pass to Waverly and south toward Boonville.\n\nLieutenant Pharis made scout from here to Freedomtown, then northwest and north to Owen's Church, and then east to Black Water, returning to Sedalia; out four days. Lieutenant Crain left Marshal on the night of 27th with 37 men. Scouted country to Waverly, then to Dover, then south to Davis Creek, thence east to Brownsville, down Black Water, and to Sedalia; out three days. Captain Turley left here on 27th with 38 men, and is yet scouting eastern portion of La Fayette. In all these scouts no enemy [has] been found. Added to these have been large escorts. South of Warsaw scouts have been through Hickory County. All quiet there. Citizen guards who have been armed are patrolling their neighborhoods. No trouble.\n\nJ. F. PHILIPS,\n\nColonel, Commanding."

S. Colored Infantry concentrated at Goodrich's Landing under your command.\n\nThat portion of the Fifty-first Regiment U. S. Colored Infantry at Milliken's Bend will not, however, be ordered to Goodrich's Landing until Colonel Wood reports that he no longer requires their services for perfecting the works at that place. The detail of men ordered from Battery D, Second Regiment U. S. Colored Artillery (light), will be directed to report to Colonel Wood without delay. He takes with him from this place the section of artillery. You will have entire control of the post and defenses at Goodrich's Landing, and will report all military operations direct to district headquarters, sending only monthly and tri-monthly returns and regimental official papers through these headquarters.\n\nI have the honor to be, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nSAML.

In case of difficulty, in their unorganized condition, without arms, [they] could be but little assistance. Some of the citizens here are somewhat concerned for the safety of Rolla. I know not what grounds there may be to apprehend danger here; you of, course, have a better opportunity of judging. If you will give me the order I will proceed at once to organize those two companies. The citizens at Saint James are very much alarmed and are very anxious that a company of my men be placed there at once. Let me hear from you.\n\nI. S.

They were rudely and hastily constructed, and with little additional labor and expense could be made tolerably strong. I would respectfully suggest that an officer of engineers be sent down to examine them and report on such improvements as may be necessary.\n\nThere are four forts or earth-works, mounting ten 24-pounder guns, around this post, and I have no artillerists to man the guns or who understand the care of them and the works; and I have the honor\n\nto represent that at least one company of heavy artillery are necessary at this post for that duty, while two would be few enough to man them in case of an attack. This post is so situated that it is the most important point on the river, north of Helena and south of Saint Louis, it being the only point from which either troops or supplies can be sent into Southeastern Missouri or Northern and Central Arkansas, on account of impassable swamps and rivers, which lie between the river and the region mentioned, extending all along down to the mouth of White River.\n\nI am, general, very respectfully,\n\nJ.

WEST:\n\nGENERAL: I have the honor to report that I left Springfield yesterday morning with my command and camped at this farm last night. Ellison's is 4 miles above Quitman. Major Childress with his force joined me at this place last night; returning, he left Clinton to the right. Major Childress gained all the information possible and was within 6 miles of White River. He reports Shelby's command at Batesville constructing ferry-boats, with his stock so broken down that he must recuperate for another move.\n\nIt is generally believed McRae is to join him there and a descent to be make on Jacksonport. Nothing said of a raid into Missouri.\n\nEvery one fit for military duty has been conscripted. Major Childress saw numerous papers ordering the holders to report on or about the 5th of next month, wherever the command of Shelby might be. Small guerrilla bands were joining Shelby. His ammunition train was said to consist of twenty wagons. Supposed he would remain in the vicinity of Batesville, wherever forage was most abundant. White River low at Batesville. Along the road Major Childress saw quite a number that were wounded at Dardanelle. I will go on to Sugar Loaf this evening. Forage scarce and cannot well stay over one night at a place on that account.\n\nVery respectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nW. F. GEIGER\n\nColonel, Commanding."

WOODS,\n\nWeston, Mo.:\n\nCAPTAIN: I am directed by the general commanding to inform you that a party of about 30 guerrillas attacked and killed a squad of Captain Snyder's company, Enrolled Missouri Militia, near a Mrs. Hamlin's, near Arnoldsville, in this county, at about 6 o'clock this morning. Some of them are known as having participated in the murder of Christian, and are named Rob and Bill Sellers, Raysdell, Fielding, Bivins, and Bird McDaniels. Captain Adams, of Ninth Missouri State Militia, has left with a detachment, with instructions to call upon any militia he may need to effect an extermination of the entire gang. Send word to Captain Wilson, at Parkville, to look out and not allow them to cross the river in that vicinity. Notify Major Clark at once of the facts, and say that General Fisk expects him to use every possible exertion in securing and exterminating the rascals. Co-operate with Captain Adams and don't miss the name this time. There can be no hoax about the matter when dead are strewn about the road and muskets scattered broadcast. A prisoner who escaped from them gives the number as counted, and also the names of such of them as were known to him.\n\nBy order of Brigadier-General Fisk:\n\nG. A. HOLLOWAY,\n\nAssistant Adjutant-General."

Two companies of the Eighth Regiment, including Company C, Captain Folsom, and such other company as you may designate,will be required to be detached for the purpose of building and garrisoning the post, in part, on James River. Your force will thus be diminished by two companies of infantry and two or three companies of cavalry from the Second Regiment. You will consider yourself instructed accordingly. It is the intention of General Sibley to be at Fort Ridgely by the day on which the march is ordered (5th proximo), or perhaps before, in case he is not prevented by the reception of orders from department headquarters.\n\nBy command of Brigadier-General Sibley:\n\nVery respectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nR. C. OLIN\n\nAssistant Adjutant-General.\n\nP. S. - If there is any other company of the Eighth Regiment composed of lumbermen, you are authorized to substitute it for Company C, if you desire to do so.\n\nBy direction of Brigadier-General Sibley:\n\nR.

Be careful that the whole country is not filled with rumors. Since messenger arrived this town is all on fire of rumors, and not from what was contained in dispatches. You will forward documents to Major Wynkoop. If you send party to Smoky Hill inform them that it is indispensable to be vigilant. I cannot see now Lieutenant Eayre could have been injured unless he was caught napping or fast asleep. Teams are en route to your camp; must be in very nearly as soon as this reaches you. Captain Backus will leave in the morning. I cannot believe that Lieutenant Eayre's command is cut off. Major Wynkoop's letter only shows that he was not at Larned on the 18th instant, and it was not expected he would be in there before the 25th.\n\nI am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nJ.

          "text": "SAINT LOUIS, MO., May 30, 1864\n\nGeneral EWING:\n\nDEAR SIR: I have carefully read the communication of A. H. Lee to \"Dear Theopheli,\" dated April 7, 1864, at Prairie du Rocher, which is all erroneous and false, except the killing of 2 guerrillas. The following are the facts in the case:\n\nWhen I charged into the village several men ran from different houses and fled toward the bluffs, but a short distance (about 150 yards), the base of which is perpendicular rocks from 30 to 50 feet high; they ascended by a narrow defile which must have been known to them. As soon as they entered the defile or oblique passage they disappeared from my sight, and I supposed they had entered a cavern, and immediately gave orders, to have it guarded, and then proceeded to search for more scoundrels but at that instant we were fired upon from the bluffs by men who were behind rocks and trees.\n\nSome of my men returned the fire, while others charged up the cliffs and killed 2 of the gang and wounded another. One of my men was severely wounded. After the fight search was made through the town for others who might be hid. During the time several guns were brought to me by soldiers, who were ordered to take all the arms from houses where the guerrillas were seen to run from. I made repeated inquiries of the citizens if any of the captured guns belonged to them. No one claimed any of them at that time. Afterward I learned that some of them belonged to citizens, and I took measures to return them. I was near Mr. Blais' store all the time we remained in town, except about fifteen or twenty minutes, when I was on the bluff. My men all behaved remarkably well in every respect. No plundering or rioting was committed; if it had been I would have known it or heard of it at the time.\n\nA buggy was procured, as soon as possible, to convey the wounded man, when I left with all my command. Before leaving, when my men were all in line, I proposed to citizens to give three cheers for Lincoln, which ws responded to by about one-half of the crowd, which was composed of 80 or 100 men. Before entering the village I said to my command that we were on an important expedition, and that no citizens should be molested in any way without my orders; and while in town I took every precaution to see that everything was properly conducted, and have always been able to maintain good order and discipline in my company. Mr. Lee is a stranger to me, of whom I know nothing.\n\nMr. Blais is undoubtedly a copperhead, for a short time since, at an election in Prairie due Rocher, he took a Republican vote from a Mr. Levrie, with an oath that he (Mr. Levrie) was a Black Republican and a traitor to his country, and that he could not cast any such votes there; also, at another time he said that any man that indorsed the administration of President Lincoln could not stay about him.\n\nThis will at any time be sworn to by several citizens who live near Prairie du Rocher, and heard him say it. I cannot close without expressing my heartfelt thanks for the privileges extended to me while under arrest with such grave charges. At the same time I keenly feel the wrong and gross injustice done me and my company by the false communication of A. H. Lee and affidavits of Blais, Cooner, and Unger, and trust they will be compelled to make proper amends.\n\nVery respectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nH. B. MILKS,\n\nCaptain Co. H, Third Cavalry, Missouri State Militia."

Hickman, Boone County.\n\nFACTS.\n\nLetter of General Clinton B. Fisk, commanding District of North Missouri, to General Rosecrans, May 31, 1864.*\n\nHenry and Henderson Bryant, slaves of Hickman, left their owner February, 1863, and sought refuge within our lines at Jefferson City. The provost-marshal gave them certificates of freedom under General Orders, No. 35, Department of the Missouri, 1863. They were employed in the quartermaster's department. Afterward went to work for one Buffington, till March, 1864. In March, 1864, they enlisted in the U. S. Army. Hickman brings action in Boone circuit court against Buffington, for $676 services and $600 value. Grand jury also indicted Buffington for unlawfully dealing with slaves. General Fisk stays proceedings.\n\nLAW.\n\nCongress by act of July 17, 1862, chapter 195, section 9, declares \"free of servitude\" and not to be again \"held as slaves,\" all slaves of persons * * * hereafter * * * in any way giving aid and comfort \" to the rebellion\" escaping from much persons and taking refuge within the lines of the Army.\"\n\nJuly 17, 1862, chapter 201, paragraph 12, Congress authorizes the President to receive \"into the service of the United States, for the purpose of constructing entrenchments or performing camp service or any other labor * * * for which they may be competent,\" persons of African descent.\n\nJuly 17, 1862, chapter 201, paragraph 12, Congress declares any slave rendering service as provided for in the act-that is, in the militia service of the United States-free, and his family also.\n\nORDERS.\n\nWar Department, General Orders, No. 139, September 24, 1862, the President enjoined upon all persons in the military and naval service to obey, observe, and enforce within their respective spheres or action the section 9 of July 17, 1862, chapter 195.\n\nGeneral Orders, Department of the Missouri, December, 24, 1862, No. 35, provost-marshals were ordered to give certificates of freedom to all slaves escaping from disloyal masters.\n\nGeneral Orders, No. 135, paragraphs II, V, VII, 1863, November 14, enlistment of colored troops ordered by the general commanding department. All able-bodied men, free or slave, to be received. Slaves declared free on enlisting, and masters to receive a certificate from an established boat. Loyal owners to be paid.\n\nN. B.-The indictment against Buffington is for \"dealing with slaves.\" Revised Statutes, chapter 150, p.33, and the courts (19th Missouri, 225, State vs. Henke) have decided that hiring labor does not come within that provision of the statute.\n\nTherefore, it appears that, by the laws of the land and general orders of the Department, the slaves of Hickman became free on entering our lines, accepting service, and afterward enrolling in the service, provided that Hickman was disloyal and had aided and abetted in any manner the rebellion. In regard to this last point the provost-marshal satisfied himself before he acted, doubtless, and General Fisk states, \"Hickman was and is a secessionist, beyond a doubt.\" The whole act of Hickman is undoubtedly intended to oppose the Government and the department and the emancipation of slaves. If General Fisk is authorized to check such proceedings now, it may save much trouble and annoyance in the future.\n\nJAMES F. DWIGHT,\n\nMajor and Acting Judge-Advocate."

A band of 40 guerrillas passed the California House, going north, on the 27th. Our forces at the Gasconade crossing and Waynesville have become very inert, and I think should be changed. I shall change the force at the Gasconade soon. I still occupy Hartsville, and will occupy Mountain Store again during the week.\n\nUnless these posts south are occupied it will be next to impossible to protect the stage and Government trains. There is little danger in holding these posts, as no large bodies of men can come into Missouri that way, as there is nothing for man or beast to eat for nearly 100 miles. Shelby has not appeared north of the Boston Mountains. Jackman designs getting the remainder of his force north by moving in small bodies up the route by the California House, and it is probable that it was a portion of his force that passed there on the 27th. He does not and will not approach any posts. There is no disturbance in the district.\n\nJOHN B. SANBORN,\n\nBrigadier-General, Commanding."

C.:\n\nDEAR GOVERNOR: Inclosed is a copy of my letter* of May 8, and copies of the indorsements+ on some other communications referring to he case of the provisional regiments of Enrolled Militia of the State who have been called into service and have been serving the United States without provision for their payment. The remedy recommended is to permit them to be mustered into the service of the United States for one year from the \t1st day of November last. It may require legislation to render this legal. I beg to remind you that the Missouri State Militia, composed of the best material in the State, has been serving with the most imperfect and often worthless arms. They have all the disadvantages of the elective system for company officers and finding their own horses, and the nature of their duties, scouting in small parties, is adverse to instruction and discipline, so that while they are more expensive to the United States their service is more trying and laborious to the men, and they are far less powerful as a body than they would be with a volunteer organization, good arms, and mounted on Government horses.\n\nTo remedy these evils I have requested authority from the War Department, to convert them, as far as practicable, into U. S. volunteers, at such time, place, and in such manner as may be most prudent and beneficial to the service. I beg you will please obtain a decision on this request. I also spoke to you of the present condition of this department, in reference to the protection of the planting industry, as well as the lives of the loyal citizens over the State. The condition of our forces is such that should any serious raid be made by the rebel cavalry we should have to sacrifice all these objects to the more pressingly important ones of guarding our depots and railroad bridges. I think it would be a great pity to abandon the people now, in the midst of their agricultural labors, second in importance only to actual combat against the enemy. I would recommend as a wise precaution that you obtain authority to raise two regiments of infantry and four of cavalry to serve for at least six months, or as much longer as practicable, on the same condition as the 100-day men of other Western States.\n\nVery respectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nW. S. ROSECRANS,\n\nMajor-General."

          "text": "OFFICE OF CHIEF ENGINEER, DEPT. OF THE GULF,\n\nNew Orleans, La., June 1, 1864.\n\nMajor GEORGE B. DRAKE,\n\nAssistant Adjutant-General:\n\nSIR: In pursuance of Special Orders, No. 16, headquarters Division of West Mississippi, referred to me for report, I have the honor to report as follows: The engineer troops in this department consist of five regiments of colored troops, with an aggregate of about 2,200, organized as infantry, but with a special view to the engineer service. The officers were selected as far as possible with a special to this service. These regiments have been employed on the construction of field-works, and with the army as pontoniers and prisoners. They were formerly denominated engineer regiments, numbering from 1 to 5; but by a recent order from the Adjutant-General, have been classed as infantry and numbered from 95 to 99, inclusive. These regiments are posted as follows: The Ninety-fifth at Brazos Island, Point Isabel, and Brownsville; the Ninety-sixth at New Orleans, en route to Port Hudson; the Ninety-seventh and Ninety-ninth with the army at Morganza, and the Ninety-eighth at Berwick City (west side of Berwick Bay). These regiments are all armed and equipped, but the arms are very inferior, being principally old smooth-bore muskets possessing no accuracy of fire.\n\nThere is also a detachment of pontoniers (about 35) now with the army at Morganza. This detachment is slowly increasing by recruits, and if the men can be obtained will constitute a company of 150 men. There is one bateau bridge in the department; 180 feet at Morganza and 280 feet at New Orleans. This bridge is much worn and requires considerable repairs. There is also a new canvas-boat bridge at New Orleans, 600 feet long, with wagons and tools complete. A few alternations are required, which will be made in a few days. There will be required for this bridge fifty 6-mule teams, six 4-mule teams, harness, and six army wagons. I have now employed quite a large topographical force of engineers and draughtsmen, which has been necessary in this department. They are at present employed in making surveys and plotting notes recently taken in the field. I propose to reduce this force as soon as this work is finished. Almost all the topographical information that it is possible to obtain of this department has been compiled, and is to be found on the maps in this office. Of the country now actually controlled by our forces we have now nearly all the information necessary for military purposes, and surveys are now going on which will render this complete.\n\nThe field-works now occupied by our forces in Louisiana are as follows:\n\nPort Hudson.- The enemy's line of works has been repaired and somewhat strengthened, and arranged for field artillery. An interior and very strong line of works has been constructed, designed for a garrison of 2,500 or 3,000 men. This line is finished, as far as its defensive properties are concerned, but considerable work is yet required to properly finish the works.\n\nBaton Rouge.-The grounds of the U. S. arsenal are inclosed by an irregular parapet. This line was first laid out by General Weitzel and has since been strengthened.\n\nPlaquemine.-A work was commenced this spring by the commanding officer of the post and is now nearly finished.\n\nDonaldsonville.-There is a very strong recount at this place.\n\nBrashear City.-There is a square, bastioned fort at this place, large enough to hold a garrison of 800 men, provided with bomb-profess, magazines, and a well.\n\nBerwick City.-There is a large and very strong tete-de-pont constructed on the west bank of Berwick Bay, which was originally built to cover the retreat of our army from New Iberia last fall, when it was threatened by superior numbers. There are also some small defensive works above the Opelousas railroad.\n\nNew Orleans.-The land approaches to the city are defended by the lines constructed by the rebels, which have been somewhat strengthened and modified since their occupation by our forces. The lines I consider sufficient to hold the city in the present position of affairs. In case of a large reduction of our force, some additional works and arrangements would be required to insure safety. I will communicate more in detail on this subject in a subsequent report . It may be remarked that the navy can defend New Orleans, having complete control of the river, more effectually than is the case with any other position of equal importance.\n\nIn regard to the \"posts in this department necessary to be held, and the strength of the garrisons required in each,\" I would report as follows: The two main routes of approach of an army from Western Louisiana are, first, by Brashear City, and, second, by the upper Atchafalaya, crossing at Simsport or other points above the mouth of the Courtableau, following the Grossetete Valley to Indian Village, crossing Plaquemine and moving by different routes to the La Fourche. The latter route was that taken by the enemy last summer during the latter part of the siege of Port Hudson. From my present information I am of the opinion that the best line of occupation for our forces west of the Mississippi River is the line from Plaquemine to Brashear City, following the lower Grand River. It will be seen from the maps that the only points at which a large force can cross this line are, first, in the vicinity of Plaquemine and Indian Village, and, second, at Brashear City. The country between these points and to the west of Grand Bayou is intersected by numerous bayou and swamps, and is destitute of routes by which an army can move. Small bodies of men, however, can penetrate the region in boats, and guerrilla operations can be extensively carried on, as well as smuggling, to a great extent; and I am credibly informed that these operations have been extensively carried on.\n\nThe occupation of the line would require, then, first, the occupation of Plaquemine and Indian Village by a force which should cover the line from the Mississippi to the mouth of Grand River, a distance of about 8 miles; second, the occupation of Brashear City; third, a reserve on the La Fourche, with headquarters at Napoleonville and outposts on all the roads leading west as far as Grand Bayou; fourth, a cavalry force to patrol the line of Grand Bayou and to scout on all the approaches to the line above indicated. All these forces should constitute a single command. I believe that this disposition of forces would be the most economical that can be adopted, unless the entire territory west of the Mississippi is abandoned. By this plan the entire triangle bounded by the Mississippi, Gulf of Mexico, and the line from Plaquemine to the mouth of the Atchafalaya will be kept free from rebel raids; protection will be continued to the inhabitants of the country, and the city of New Orleans be kept free from all excitement produced by the near approach of rebel forces.\n\nThe presence of gun-boats at Berwick Bay will materially assist in the defense of that position, which can only be taken by a force crossing in boats and investing the place by the rear. The position at Indian Village and points in that vicinity at which the bayou can be crossed can be fortified. I would estimate the forces necessary to hold this line at 12,000 troops, white and black; 1,500 should be cavalry. The infantry and artillery should be posted as follows: Four thousand five hundred at Plaquemine, Indian Village, and vicinity; 5,500 on the La Fourche and picketing all the routes leading in from the west; 2,000 at Brashear City and on the railroad west of La Fourche Bayou. Each of these forces should have selected a defensive point on the Mississippi to which they could retire in case of necessity, those at Indian Village to Plaquemine or Bayou Goula; those on the La Fourche can best reach the river at Donaldsonville. There is also a road leading direct from Thibodeaux to the Mississippi; this latter road requires repairs. With this disposition of forces and with proper watchfulness, there will always be time to withdraw the force at Brashear City, should this become advisable. As to the approaches from the east, I consider that, in addition to the garrisons at Baton Rouge and Port Hudson, and the garrisons of the permanent posts, a force of 6,000 men will be sufficient for the defense of New Orleans, the only approaches being by Pass Manchac and Bonnet Carre. Any large force approaching New Orleans from the east must eventually encounter our defensive line at Camp Parapet, which can easily be held by the force mentioned, assisted by the gun-boats on the flank. This force foots up to 18,000, which is the minimum, in my opinion, for the defense of New Orleans and the river, including the occupation of the territory already under our control.\n\nThis plan does not involve the abandonment of any positions now occupied by our troops, and I do not consider that any of these positions can be abandoned unless all the troops are withdrawn to the line of the Mississippi. In this case the troops on the west bank of the river should be posted in strong redoubts at suitable points along the river, where they could receive the maximum assistance from the navy. The garrisons of these works should number about 800 each. These works, being strong enough to resist any sudden assault, will serve as a rendezvous for our fleet, and enable re-enforcements to be promptly landed at the threatened point. The main force should be posted on the right bank of the river opposite New Orleans, to prevent the occupation of that position by the enemy. The total force might thus be reduced to 12,000 men. Id in addition to these garrisons, a movable force is organized which can be readily thrown by transports to any point, the problem of holding the river will be solved in the most economical manner possible.\n\nIn regard to the positions held on the coast, Fort Pickens and Barrancas require a garrison of 2,000 men. These may be colored troops.\n\nFort at Ship Island.-This fort is not armed, except with a few naval guns temporarily in position. There is a colored regiment at this post, which is sufficient. The work should be armed as soon as possible, as the position is an important one in view of foreign complications. The casemate tier is ready for its guns. The permanent works in Louisiana are in good order and improvements are being made.\n\nPass Cavallo, Tex.-This is a point of great importance with reference to future operations, and should be held if the troops can possibly be spared. The garrison now is, I am informed, about 2,500 men. They should be able to maintain their position, which is on an island. The position is intrenched, though originally for a large force.\n\nBrazos Santiago and Brownsville.-These points may be of great importance to us in case of a foreign war or subsequent operations with the rebels, and, like other inlets on the Texas coast, they are very difficult to take if held by the enemy. I consider the harbor of Brazos a very important one in the present position of affairs, and I would recommend the construction of a permanent work for a garrison of 800 men on Brazos Island. This work should command the entrance to the harbor and be strong enough on the land side to require a siege.\n\nPositions necessary to be occupied and garrisons necessary to hold the country now in our possession in the Department of the Gulf.\n\nNew Orleans and immediate outposts.........................6,000\n\nBaton Rouge.................................................1,000\n\nPort Hudson.................................................2,500\n\nPlaquemine, Indian Village, and vicinity...................4,500\n\nLa Fourche reserve, including Donaldsonville..............5,500\n\nBrashear City and railroad..................................2,000\n\nTotal......................................................21,500\n\nA large proportion of these troops may be colored.\n\nGarrisons of other points.\n\nPensacola.................................................2,000\n\nShip Island............................................... 500\n\nPass Cavallo..............................................2,000\n\nBrazos....................................................1,500\n\nTotal.....................................................6,000\n\nThe above estimates refer to the simple occupation of the territory now held in this department, without reference to the disposition of forces elsewhere on the river, by which they might be materially reduced.\n\nI am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nD. C. HOUSTON,\n\nMajor and Chief Engineer, Department of the Gulf."

FISK:\n\nDEAR SIR: I assume the privilege of addressing the commander of my district in relation to bushwhackers in Ray County, Mo. From the earliest day of this rebellion I have been an active worker against traitors to this Government. There have been two raids made in this county in the last week. I, with a party of the loyal citizens of Crab Orchard, have been the first to the point of action. I, on the point of a raid being made on last Saturday night or last night got together 9 men. I took the brush. I landed on the Missouri River bank just at the dawn of day yesterday morning, and secreted my men at the crossings of these thieves. At 8 o'clock in the morning they sent a man out on the opposite side of the river; he halloed over. Just at that time I had been detected by arresting 3 young men who were passing the point where they had been swimming the river. This man who came out and halloed got on his horse and retired back into the brush.\n\nThey stole my horse the night of the 23rd. The marauders are threatening my store and life all the time, all, they say, for arresting Lewis Vandovier, as he was one of their friends. It is supposed in some circles that I am laying myself liable to be presented to the grand jury for passing through the country with armed men without any authority. Now, I ask you for your opinion on this point. Suppose, I or any of my men, kill a thief while acting in our own defense, what will be the consequences? The copperheads have the power in their own hands with the civil law in this county. They have not offered me nor the loyal people of this section any protection. We feel if we are protected it must be by our own strategy. Let civil law do as it may, we don't feel like letting the guerrillas assassinate and plunder us, and wait for the civil law to bring them to justice, for the civil law has never brought a felon to justice since the rebellion commenced. The rebels think it wrong for a Union man to sell goods in Ray County. I am attempting it with this fear, that when I retire at night I do not know but that I may be burned out or assassinated before the rising of the next sun, and that is the way Union men are protected here. I would be pleased to hear from you at your earliest convenience.\n\nI am, sir, your most obedient servant,\n\nABRAHAM ALLEN."

Colonel McLane sends me word that 200 camped near Patton, at a mill, last night. I have sent 200 men in two directions after them. Ewing, at Charleston, reports one company. I have sent 25 men to him, and have ordered him to go after them. Hiller reports a force at Cane Island, and a gentleman late from Doniphan says they are there and picket all the roads. Number not known. Besides these parties, small squads are everywhere in the swamps. Hiller is after them. My whole force is on the move and we will clear them out, or try. But I think that they are covering some more important move by this cloud of guerrillas. Those at the mill were grinding corn all night. I think McRae means mischief at Patterson. What do you think of bringing Dallas to Jackson, within supporting distance?\n\nJ. B. ROGERS,\n\nColonel, Commanding."

OF THE NORTHWEST,\nSaint Paul, Minn., May 30, 1864.\n\nMajor General JOHN POPE, Milwaukee:\n\nGENERAL: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your dispatch of 26th instant covering one of a like tenor to Brigadier-General Sully. Your orders will of course be obeyed to the extent of my ability, although I will not attempt to conceal my apprehensions that the departure of the Sixth Minnesota Volunteers will leave a very inadequate force for the security of our extensive frontier in the present critical state of our relations with the Indians. As it will be necessary for me to reduce the garrison at Fort Snelling to the lowest practicable limit, I respectfully ask for instruction to dispatch the Indian prisoners there, embracing some 80 men, women, and children, to Davenport, to remain there with the other captives until they are otherwise disposed of. I do not embrace Little Six and his co-chief Medicine Bottle in this application, as I propose to try them here for their manifold crimes by a military commission.\n\nIt will be impossible for me to furnish troops to enforce the draft now going on in this State, and I fear there will be serious difficulty in some of the counties. The preparations for the post at James River will be urged forward so as to enable the detachment to leave by 15th or 20th proximo. From all the information I can obtain there is no point on the James River where there is sufficient timber for the uses of a military post, and should that prove the case after a thorough exploration I shall cause the post to be established at the Head of the Coteau, as you directed.\n\nThe country continues parched to an excessive degree, and in consequence I anticipate much difficulty in obtaining forage on the part of the expeditionary force. But they must get along as well as they can. I shall leave on the 2nd proximo for Fort Ridgely to superintend the departure of the column ordered to march on the 5th. I have telegraphed General Sully that it would move from that post at that time. You can depend upon it that there will be no lack of vigor or activity in carrying out your programme in this district with the limited means at my disposal. It would be well if an engineer officer could be obtained to select the side and direct the construction of the James River post, and I respectfully suggest that application be made for one without delay. Failing in this the officer in command will be furnished with a plan of the post from these headquarters.\n\nI am, general, with high respect, your obedient servant,\n\nH. H. SIBLEY,\n\nBrigadier-General, Commanding."

The men composing each company will be kept together at all times. Upon approaching land or going up a narrow river the company will immediately form, facing outward, and stand under arms, the men being fully equipped and ready to disembark without breaking ranks.\n\nCompany commanders must remain at all times with their companies, except when out of sight of land, when they may retire to the cabins.\n\nII. Proper means of exit on each transport must be prepared to facilitate the disembarkation. Strong stairs must be ready to be placed at each gangway, forward and aft, at a moment's a warning.\n\nIII. Two non-commissioned officers must be placed at each gangway to assist in disembarking the troops, and to pass to them their muskets and knapsacks. Strong gang-planks must be prepared and placed near each gangway, ready for immediate use.\n\nIV. The signal for starting will be the American flag under the Union jack at the fore, on the steam transport Sylph, the flag-ship of Brigadier General John P. Hatch. Each brigade headquarters will repeat the signal for sailing immediately after being hoisted on the flag-ship. The transports will sail in the following order: Brigadier General John P. Hatch, on transport Sylph, followed by transports containing the Hilton Head troops; Brigadier General W. Birney, on transport N. P. Banks, followed by transports containing the Florida troops, with the Thirty-fourth U. S. Colored Troops; Brigadier General R. Saxton, on transport Flora, followed by transports containing the Beaufort troops. The several brigades must keep together as much as possible, also the vessels comprising each brigade, in order that they may be distinguished. The speed of the vessels to correspond with the slowest sailing transport of each brigade.\n\nV. The thole-pins of the small boats must be secured by lanyards underneath. Trail-lines must be fitted to secure the oars when dropped over. Painters new and strong.\n\nVI. The flag of the major-general commanding will be blue, with white castle in the center.\n\nBy command of Major General J. B. Foster:\n\nW. L. BURGER,\n\nAssistant Adjutant-General."

Neither of the artillery companies ordered to me by Special Orders, Numbers 105, current series, from Adjutant and Inspector General's Office, have arrived; nor have I yet a man of the South Carolina reserves. Three artillery companies have been disbanded on James Island, and I cannot supply their places. This is a serious loss just at this time. This place will be in great danger if the enemy concentrates his troops on this coast against it. Can anything be done to aid me?

          "text": "HEADQUARTERS DAVIS' BRIGADE, Hilton Head, S. C., July 14, 1864.\n\nSIR: I have the honor to submit the following report of the operations of my brigade in the late expedition to John's Island down to time I was wounded and obliged to go to the rear:\n\nThe brigade, composed of the One hundred and fourth Pennsylvania Volunteers, One hundred and fifty-seventh and One hundred and forty-fourth New York Volunteers, embarked at Hilton Head on steamers on Friday afternoon, the 1st of July, and left the harbor about sunset. Upon opening the sealed instructions given me before starting, I found my destination to be North Edisto, and accordingly steamed in that direction. We arrived off the bar at 2 a .m., but were obliged to wait until daylight before we could cross. Entering the mouth of the river I disembarked my brigade at Seabrook soon after sunrise, and by order of Brigadier-General Hatch, commanding, pushed forward to Haulover Cut, 5 miles from the landing, at the point where we were to cross to John's Island. The One hundred and forty-fourth New York Volunteers had the advance, and when they arrived at the cut, they found a small body of rebel cavalry there, which retired without disputing the passage. Colonel Slidell threw out skirmishers and was secured the approaches on the side of the enemy. The bridge across the cut had been destroyed some time before, and until it should be repaired neither artillery nor wagons could cross over. On reaching that point with the other two regiments of the brigade, I set my pioneer corps at work to rebuild the bridge, in charge of Quartermaster Lehnen, of the One hundred and fourth Pennsylvania Volunteers, and in less than four hours they built a bridge of 66 feet span, with two abutments and two piers, of sufficient strength to pass artillery and cavalry. General Hatch joined the advance in the afternoon, but toward evening returned to Seabrook. I made the best disposition possible for the safety of the command and the night was passed without alarm.\n\nDuring the night two regiments of General Saxton's brigade came up, and in the morning the third regiment and the battery reported. General Hatch returned to the front at daylight and assumed the direction of the expedition. The troops advanced at about 8 a. m., my brigade leading, and bivouacked on the main road, about 4 miles from Haulover Cut, near a place called Parker's. We reached there about 11 o'clock, Saxton's brigade coming up about 5 o'clock in the afternoon. We remained there all night. Soon after halting an officer with a small body of cavalry reported to me that there were four pieces of artillery and 200 infantry at a point about 4 miles to our right, which General Schimmelfenning had sent to re-enforce us.\n\nI marched the next morning, the 4th instant, at 5 o'clock, taking the right-hand or lower road, which covered more securely our new base of supplies, which had been transferred to the StoNumbers The day was unusually hot and sultry, and the men suffered severely from the dust and heat. We reached the point where the road branches to the right to go to Legareville about noon, and halted there for the day. Surgeon Robinson, One hundred and fourth Pennsylvania Volunteers, during the march, unfortunately fell into the hands of the enemy. Leaving the camp after the brigade had marched, he took the wrong road and rode into the enemy's lines before he was aware of it. Company G, of the same regiment, following as rear guard, also got off the road and encountered the enemy's skirmishers, but effected its return to the regiment without any loss. A few of the enemy's vedettes were seen on the march and wounded 1 cavalryman in the ankle.\n\nThe next day we marched about 5 miles, near to a point known as the Huts, which the advance reached about 9 o'clock. This was found to be a strong position, with an impassable swamp on our right flank and front, and it was concluded to advance no farther. After securing the crossing I sent skirmishers to the front and seized the woods and open country for about three-fourths of a mile. During the afternoon a force of some 200 of the enemy showed themselves in our immediate front on both sides of the main road. As there were indications of an advance on their part, I sent out Captain Laughlin, of the One hundred and fourth pennsylvania Volunteers, with a detachment of sharpshooters, who quickly drove them from the hedges and ditches they were behind to the woods a half mile beyond. To make my position secure for the night, I placed two Napoleon guns in battery at the bridge, and dug a line of rifle-pits from the road to the edge of the swamp covering our left and rear. General Hatch and staff came to the front shortly after dark, when he assumed command.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, the 6th instant, while at the picket-line examining the position a piece of artillery the enemy had brought down hand by the explosion of a shell, which compelled me to go to the rear. I placed Colonel P. P. Brown, One hundred and fifty-seventh New York Volunteers, in command of my brigade, who will make a report of its subsequent operations. It affords me pleasure to return my thanks to Major Place, One hundred and fifty-seventh New York Volunteers, and Lieutenant McCoy, One hundred and fourth Pennsylvania Volunteers, serving on my staff, for their efficient assistance. Lieutenant-Colonel Bennett, One hundred and second U. S. Colonel Troops, was temporarily attached to my staff, and I am also under many obligations to him. Before I left camp I organized a small battalion of sharpshooters, which I placed under the command of Captain Laughlin One hundred and fourth Pennsylvania Volunteers. They rendered the most valuable assistance, and on every occasion the conduct of Captain Laughlin and his officers and men was marked with great gallantry.\n\nI remain, very respectfully,\n\nW. W. H. DAVIS,\n\nColonel 104th Pennsylvania Vols., Commanding Brigadier\n\nMajor E. L. ROGERS,\n\nActing Assistant Adjutant-General."

          "text": "Report of Major Edward H. Little, One hundred and twenty-seventh New York Infantry, of assault on Fort Johnson and Battery Simkins.\n\nHDQRS. 127TH REGIMENT NEW YORK VOLUNTEERS, Morris Island, S. C., July 3, 1864.\n\nCAPTAIN: I have the honor to submit the following report:\n\nIn compliance with verbal orders received, I embarked the One hundred and twenty-seventh New York Volunteers on the night of the 2nd instant, between the hours 10 and 12. At 1.30 this a. m. we were all in position at Paine's Dock. It was arranged between Colonel Hoyt and myself that his regiment should lead the advance, moving by the right flank, and when he (Colonel Hoyt) had gained sufficient ground to the right he would flank to the left in line of battle toward the works on Johnson's Point. I was to continue moving by the right flank, passing to the rear of the Fifty-second Pennsylvania, and when I had gained sufficient ground to the right to get all my boats in line beyond the bar I was to flank to the left and advance toward Simkins. With this understanding the boats left Paine's Dock at 2 a. m. I had formed the regiment into three divisions of five boats each, Captain Gurney commanding the right, Captain Allison the center, and Captain Henry the left. Each chief of division had a lieutenant in his boat and each of the other boats was commanded by a commissioned officer and ordered to follow their division leaders. My own boat contained, besides myself, the adjutant, sergeant-major, a bugler, and signalman, 4 oarsmen, and a cockswain.\n\nBefore we reached the mouth of Vincent's Creek I found that Captains Gurney and Henry's divisions had passed ahead of eight or ten of the boats of the Fifty-second Pennsylvania. I ordered them to halt and allow the Fifty-second Pennsylvania to pass. Soon after the line halted I went forward to see what the trouble was, and found that the boat immediately in advance of the boats containing the major of the Fifty-second Pennsylvania had halted without cause and was between 200 and 300 yards in rear of its file leader. I asked the major if he was aware that the boat ahead of him had stopped. I forget what answer he made, but soon after the line moved on slowly. When near Fort Putnam the line field to the left and advanced a short distance and again halted. I went forward to see what the matter was, and again found that a number of the boats of the Fifty-second Pennsylvania had halted without cause. While urging them to move on, Colonel Hoyt came form the right of the line and ordered them to move on faster, saying that the other boats were half a mile ahead. Again the line moved on somewhat faster. At this time day began to break. In about ten minutes afterward I discovered that a large number of boats were congregated together, some of them with their oars locked, none of them trying to move forward. I found that they had inclined too much to the left, and were south and east from the bar the juts out from Simkins and close to the land. On the other side of the bar I saw two or three boats moving toward Johnson's Point. There was a narrow break as fast as possible and land with the boats ahead. Among this group of boats I found the major of the Fifty-second. I said, \"Major Jayne, why don't you exert yourself, and order your boats to move forward?\" I cannot remember what reply he made; some one in his boat said that they were awaiting orders, or that somebody wanted to give orders. I asked if the colonel or lieutenant-colonel was there. I could get no answer. About 100 yards in rear of this group I saw a boat that looked like the one used by Colonel Gurney; thinking he was aboard, I rowed out to it. I found it contained Lieutenant Haviland, who was acting as aide to Colonel Gurney. I asked him where Colonel Gurney was. He said Colonel Gurney was at Paine's Dock. I told him that the boats would not move forward. He said, \"Shall I tell Colonel Gurney that the movement is a failure?\" to which I made no reply, but went back to the boats. I called to the officers of the boats and asked them to land their men: just then the rebels fired their signal gun and immediately opened with their batteries. I called to them again to land; that it was their only chance to save themselves. Some of the boats moved forward through the break in the bar as if to land. Soon after the signal gun was fired the rebels opened a musketry fire form Simkins, which rapidly increased in volume, but without much effect, as we were about 250 yards from the works. When I saw that the boats showed a disposition to land I ordered my boat to pass through the break in the bar in order that I might land above Simkins. As I was moving forward a pontoon got foul of my boat and crowded it against the bank. At this time the rebels fired very rapidly, and were sweeping the beach with grape and canister from a gun at Johnson. I could not see a man or boat on the beach, but as far as I could see to the right the boats were retreating from the beach and heading toward Sumter. Concluding that the movement had been given by Colonel Hoyt, who I judged to be on the right, I ordered my boat to go about. I then found all the boats that were behind me were in full retreat, excepting Captain Henry's pontoon, which had previously landed on the marsh in front of Simkins, and were still firing at the rebels behind that work. When they found that the attack had been abandoned they took to their boat and got off without the loss of a man. I ordered my boat to head for Fort Putnam and finally went into Vincent's Creek and landed at Strong, as my oarsmen had been constantly at work from the time the troops commenced to embark.\n\nIf the proper spirit had been shown, if the efforts of the colonel and lieutenant-colonel of the Fifty-second Pennsylvania had been properly supported, I think the movement would have been a success. For my own regiment, I can say that both officers and men obeyed promptly and cheerfully at the orders I gave them.\n\nFollowing is a list of casualties in my command: Private Lake, Company A, contusion on shoulder from shell; Sergeant Wells, Company G, arm, slight.\n\nVery respectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nEDWARD H. LITTLE,\n\nMajor, Commanding Regiment.\n\nCaptain R. H. L. JEWETT,\n\nActing Assistant Adjutant-General."

C., July 4, 1864.\n\nOn the morning of the 2nd instant the enemy landed several regiments on south end of James Island, supported by two monitors and 2 field pieces and commenced intrenching. At the same time several gun-boats and transports with troops with troops came up the North Edisto. At early dawn yesterday from 700 to 1,000 men in barges attached Fort Johnson and were handsomely and thoroughly repulsed, with the loss to the enemy of 140 prisoners, with their arms and accouterments 5 barges, and many killed and wounded. Our loss very slight. The enemy on south end of James Island fell back hastily yesterday before our men, leaving their dead unburied, and our picket-line is re-established, but the monitors and gun-boats are still in the Stono firing heavily on our lines, and another transport has just come up with troops. The party from North Edisto landed at White Point and advanced, but were met and driven back. So far the enemy has been repulsed at all points, with loss of about 600 men;s but the position and movements of the enemy on James and John's Islands and adjacent river threaten most serious danger to this city. I am in extreme need of re-enforcements; have not yet any of the South Carolina reserves. My men are greatly exhaust and under the incessant fire of the monitors and gun-boats. Two-thirds of them will soon be unfit for duty. Some assistance should be speedily sent to me. Please lay this before the President.\n\nSAM.

Brown, jr., One hundred and fifty-seventh New York Infantry, of expedition to John's Island and skirmishers.\n\nHEADQUARTERS 157TH NEW YORK VOLUNTEERS, Folly Island, S. C., February 14, 1864.\n\nCAPTAIN: In compliance with circular received February 13, I have the honor to submit the following report of the part sustained by this regiment in the late expedition into Seabrook Island:\n\nThe One and fifty-seventh New York Volunteers left camp on the evening of Sunday, February 7, with 173 armed men, 10 cooks, 4 stretcher-bearers, 10 pioneers, 3 hospital attendants, 3 detailed as orderlies; total, 203 men, commanded by 1 field, 2 staff, 3 line, and 4 acting officers; total force, 213. In accordance with orders from brigade headquarters, the regiment proceeded to Stono Landing, where it arrived a little after 8 p. m. It was ferried across to Kiawah Island 12.30 o'clock the same night, and at once commenced march on the left of the brigade. It arrived at the Vanderhost plantation at daybreak, and bivouacked during the night at that place, in the same order in the brigade. March was resumed at 9 p. m., the regiment being third form the right. In this order it arrived at the Seabrook plantation in the early morning, when it was at once ordered to throw out skirmishers. Lieutenant Gates, with Company G and parts of Companies A and I, was detailed for that purpose, making a force of 40 men. Lieutenant Gates advanced under the direction of General Ames at 8.15 a. m.,and was immediately met by a brisk fire from the rebel skirmishers, who had advanced from the woods and were charging over a rise of ground. They obtained possession of a line of hedge and ditch, but were speedily dislodged by our men, who drove them into the open filed. Here our line was re-enforced by a body of the Seventy-fifth Ohio Volunteers, who deployed on our right. Colonel Harris, Seventy-fifth Ohio Volunteers, here took command, and the line advancing pushed the rebels into the woods and continued driving them from half a dozen positions, until a halt was ordered at the distance of about 2 1\\2 miles from the main force. Major Rice, One hundred and forty-fourth New York, had command at this time.\n\nIn the mean time the regiment had advanced with the brigade into the field of the first skirmish, having formed line of battle and the flank on the left of the brigade up the main road through the woods and field at the rear of the picket-line, already established by Major Rice. One hundred and forty-fourth New York Volunteers. Colonel Brown was then ordered to take command of the One hundred and seventh Ohio Volunteers, which, with his own regiment, was to form the left wing of the advance. The One hundred and seventh Ohio Volunteers were then orders forward as skirmishers, the One hundred and fifty-seventh New York Volunteers following as a reserve. The line having advanced in this order over two wide fields, it was checked upon entering the third by a fire form the rebel skirmishers, who were strongly intrenched. This was communicated to General Ames, who ordered a cessation of the advance, and afterward the withdrawal of the line. Just before the line was checked parties were dispatched to search the buildings of a plantation near the river and destroy all arms found there. The line was withdrawn in good order. The regiment was then ordered to the rear, where it bivouacked behind the earth-works already alluded to . They were at once strengthened so as to form a ditch and parapet of considerable strength.\n\nIn this position the regiment remained from Tuesday afternoon until Thursday noon, February 11. It was then ordered, with the One hundred and seventh Ohio Volunteers and Seventy-third Ohio, to advance in support of columns already advanced. Marching by the flank, this force, under the direction of General Ames, proceeded along the left of the forest to within supporting distance of the skirmishers and batteries previously sent out. The regiment took no other active part in this day's operations until it was ordered at dusk to establish a chain of outposts to connect with those of the One hundred and sixty-ninth New York Volunteers on the extreme right. This was executed as speedily as possible, a line of about forty-five posts of 3 men each being established at intervals of 15 paces, in favorable positions, and a reserve of 30 kept in the rear. At midnight orders were received for the withdrawal of the line, which was effected noiselessly and in good order, and the regiment rejoined the brigade between 1 and 2 a. m. It then marched on the left of the brigade from the scene of as action, and reached camp at 4 p. m., Friday, February 12.\n\nI have to report William Pierce, Company I, mortally wounded in the skirmish of the first day, and J. Quick, Company I, not seriously; also M. B. Sheldon, missing (supposed to have strayed away on the last night to sleep). He is half-witted.\n\nOur men report having seen 1 rebel captain killed (who was afterward decently interred) and 1 rebel wounded, besides several carried off by their comrades. They captured 3 rebels. One horse, 3 carbines, and 3 sabers were taken by us.\n\nI have to transmit herewith the report of Lieutenant Gates, commanding our force of skirmishers.\n\nP. P. BROWN, JR.,\n\nColonel, Commanding 157th New York Volunteers.\n\nCaptain J. M. BROWN,\n\nAssistant Adjutant-General, Ames' Brigade."

Hilton Head:\n\nGENERAL: You may remember that some importance has been attached to the passage between Port Royal and Calibogue Sound, and I have been written to by yourself and the general of the district in regard to its security by water. Last night some examination of the approaches by water were made by one of my officers without being perceived by your pickets. He anchored in a tug some 50 feet from Hilton Head Island, near the entrance of Scull Creek, and after passing entirely around Pinckney Island came through Scull Creek, nearly touching the steam-boats at the coal wharf with his oars; he was never once hailed form the shore. I may inform you, by the way, that the results of these examinations indicates that Scull Creek is tolerably well observed by one of my steamers at each outlet, and may be made impassable to the rebels by a battery, &c. But Mackay Creek is unguarded, and with water sufficient for rebel rams or other vessels to pass. I shall order it to be obstructed by a boom at its entrance into the Checkhessee River, but as Pinckney Island is not occupied by the troops, this may be easily cut loose. In order, therefore, to make sure of closing this passage, I would suggest that pickets be placed to give notice or hinder any attempt of the kind. Some battery should also be placed, because I have posted two steamers to watch Scull Creek, and have no others to spare. If either are drawn off to where Mackay Creek enters May River, Scull Creek will be more or less opened.\n\nI am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nJ. A. DAHLGREN,\n\nRear-Admiral, Commanding S. Atlantic Blockading Squadron."

This will show the whole amount available will only convey about 5,000 men in operations about the coast. This is the least number of men that should be used in making raids, and the least number of vessels for that purpose and for supplying the different districts with quartermaster and subsistence supplies.\n\nI do not see how the transportation now in this department can be reduced with safety. A considerable number of the steamers are useless and are being repaired, but they are being put in condition for active service as rapidly as possible. Several other small steamers have been sent North, either to be discharged or for repairs that cannot be made here.\n\nI have directed my particular attention to the transportation since I took command, have made available all that could be used in expeditions, and have taken the necessary steps to have all the unserviceable vessels either repaired here or sent North for this purpose or to be discharged.\n\nVery respectfully, general, your obedient servant,\n\nJ.

We may at any time find it necessary, as we have already done, to cross over and attack the enemy on similar islands, to which we have no means of approach except row-boats. The navy howitzers being capable of transportation in row-boats, and it being perfectly practicable where there are no horses to draw them by hand, the general considers them as a most useful piece of ordnance to have in this command.\n\nI have the honor to be, your obedient servant,\n\nE.

          "text": "Major C. T. CHRISTENSEN,\nAsst. Adjt. General, Hdqrs. div. of West Mississippi:\n\nMAJOR: In compliance with General Orders, Numbers 3, headquarters Division of West Mississippi, I beg to report regarding affairs in this district and its vicinity. Most of the rebel troops in West Florida and Alabama have left to re-enforce Johnston at Atlanta and Polk, Forrest, and Roddey's army, on the Mobile and Ohio Railroad, in Mississippi. Refugees and deserters report the balance of rebel troops in my neighborhood distributed as follows: Mobile, militia only enough to do the guard duty; Fort Morgan, 600 men; Camp Withers, two companies cavalry; Camp Andrew, at Bonsecours Bay, four companies infantry, guarding salt-works; Camp Powell, near Perdido River, one company cavalry; at Pollard, five companies infantry and the Fifteenth Confederate Cavalry, Colonel Maury commanding, under marching orders; at Fifteen-Mile Station, on the pensacola and Pollard Railroad, 500 cavalry and three pieces artillery; between the Escambia and Chattahoochee Rivers, three companies of cavalry; at and around Milton, one-half company at Elba, one-half at Abbeville, one-half at Newton, and one at Marianna.\n\nConsidering the comparatively very small number of rebel troops thus scattered in West Florida and Alabama, in twenty counties, comprising more than 20,000 square miles, I beg respectfully to recommend a cavalry raid as far as Columbus, Ga. Possessing the most minute information, I am confident that 2,000 men, well mounted and armed, would be sufficient to do the work safely and obtain brilliant results of vital importance, facilitating greatly the success of our armies in Virginia and Georgia, and while much reducing the rebel resources in general, forcing, especially, starvation upon Mobile, thus rendering one of the most formidable rebel strongholds comparatively helpless. If enabled by the commanding general to make the raid, I would enter Saint Andrew' Bay on steamers, land near Bethem's Mill, at McCormick's Landing (15 feet depth), and destroy the numerous salt-works, with a daily produce of 500 bushels of salt for the so-called Confederacy; take the Hickory (Orange) Hill road, and, leaving Marianna, Abbeville, and Fort Gaines on the right, enter Newton (a rebel depot for bacon and corn), strike the terminus of the Macon and Georgetown Branch Railroad at Eufaula, destroy the railroad and telegraph line, and leaving Union Spring to the left, cross the railroad at Silver's Station, and destroy the Mobile and Girard Railroad, enter Columbus, Ga., destroy all the Government machine-shops, factories and manufactories, and fifteen warehouses full of cotton; destroy also the Columbus and Macon, Columbus and Opelika, and West point and Montgomery Railroads. From Opelika I would continue on the north side of the railroad to Wetumpka, a military prison, with over 3,000 Union prisoners, and, liberating the, march upon Montgomery, the capital of Alabama, and destroying the railroad around the city, with the Government machine-shops and cotton warehouses, proceed on the public road east of the railroad down to Pollard; there also destroy the railroad, numerous engines, and very valuable rolling-stock, and return from Pollard via Fifteen-Mile House and Pensacola to Barrancas.\n\nAlong the line above designated the roads are good, somewhat sandy in Florida, but hard in Alabama, nowhere intersected by rivers, it being throughout the water divide. The country from Hickory Hill upward is rich and productive. Men and horses could subsist upon the country and find everywhere good fresh water in abundance.\n\nThe people on the designated line from Hickory Hill to Columbus are tired of rebellion and anxious to return to the Union, and the woods being full of deserters, I am confident that by starting with 2,000 men I would strike at Columbus with double that number.\n\nI beg to inclose (Sub-A*) a table of distances, going by water 120 miles and by land 452; time required, sixteen to twenty days. A glance upon the map of the United States shows, and the past conduct of the rebellion proves, that the Mobile, Montgomery and Columbus Railroad, with its tributaries and connections, is one of the main and vital arteries of the rebel Confederacy, and the only undisturbed line of communication between Richmond, Savannah, and Charleston with the lower Mississippi regions and the Gulf States, and it seems beyond a doubt that the destruction of such an important railroad line at seven different pints, as within contemplated, with the destruction of numerous engines, valuable rolling-stock, and all other rebel property above alluded to, would certainly be a stunning blow upon the hydra of this wicked rebellion. I therefore most respectfully request the commanding general's sanction to make the raid, and his orders for the use of a cavalry force of 2,000 for the time of the one month only. At present I have but one company of cavalry mounted, Company M, Fourteenth New York Cavalry, numbering 80 men and 59 horses. The Florida cavalry, already six companies strong, have no arms and no horses. The men all entered my lines from rebeldom and enlisted in the U. S. Army with the fervent desire to revenge under the Union flag all the wrongs inflicted upon them and their families by the rebels. They are all good horsemen, all good marksmen, and perfectly familiar with the country and people throughout Florida, Alabama, and Georgia. Thus their services in the field, if well mounted and armed, would prove more efficient here than of any veteran cavalry regiment. I beg, therefore, to inclose duplicate of requisitions already forwarded for arms and horses, respectfully requesting the commanding general's approval and orders, and I confidently hope that the 500 Florida men when mounted will each, in les than a month, bring an additional horse from rebeldom into their camp.\n\nFor the present I am restricted to my small infantry force, ad although without proper land and water transportation, I will make an infantry advance in a few days up to Perdido with the view of doing considerable harm to the rebels.\n\nVery respectfully, major, your obedient servant,\n\nASBOTH,\n\nBrigadier-General, Commanding."

C.:\n\nGENERAL: Your notes of the 7th instant, marked private, are just received. I have no opportunity to communicate with General Grant with regard to their contents, as the telegraph line is not in operation to his headquarters, but will give you his views as I understand them.\n\nIn directing General Gillmore to bring to Fortress Monroe all troops in his department not required to hold our positions there on the defensive, General Grant did not intend that no demonstrations or tracks should be made against the enemy which the commanding general should deem feasible. He will expect you to employ your troops in the way you may deem most advantageous. It is proper to remark in this connection that General Gillmore has recently reported that he left more troops in the Department of the South than he deemed absolutely necessary for a simple defense, and that he has evidence that a greater portion of Beauregard's forces are now in front of Richmond. He therefore recommends that, if no offensive operations are intended there, at least 5,000 men can be spared from your department. This recommendation was submitted to General Grant, but no action on it has been taken by him.\n\nVery respectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nH. W. HALLECK,\n\nMajor-General and Chief of Staff."

FOSTER,\n\nCommanding Department of the South, Hilton Head:\n\nGENERAL: I send with this a letter addressed by 5 general officers of the U. S. Army, now prisoners of war in this city, to Brigadier General L. Thomas, Adjutant-General U. S. Army, recommending and asking an exchange of prisoners of war. I fully concur in opinion with the officers who have signed the letter that there should be an exchange of prisoners of war, and, although I am not instructed by my Government to enter into negotiations for that purpose, I have no doubt that it is willing and desirous now, as it has ever been, to exchange prisoners of war with your Government on just and honorable plans. Our difficulty in the way of carrying out the cartel of exchange agreed on between the two Governments would not exist, that I am aware of, if the exchange was conducted between you and myself. If, therefore, you think proper to communicate on the subject with your Government I will, without delay, communicate with mine, and it may be that we can enter into an agreement, subject to the approval of our respective Governments, by which the prisoners of war now languishing in confinement may be released. I should be glad to aid in so humane a work, and to the end that there may be no unnecessary delay on my part I have directed an officer of my staff, Major John F. Lay, assistant adjutant and inspector general, charged with the delivery of this, to wait a reasonable time in the vicinity of Port Royal Ferry for you answer. He is fully informed of my views on this subject, and, if you desire it, will confer with you or any officer you may designate.\n\nVery respectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nSAM. JONES,\n\nMajor-General, Commanding."

I would again call the attention of the major-general commanding to the danger of an attack from the combined naval force of the enemy upon the southern end of Hilton Head Island, unless an ample naval force is kept in Calibogue Sound.\n\nVery respectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nJNO. P. HATCH,\n\nBrigadier-General, Commanding.\n\nP. S.- There is in Savannah a steam-ship built since the war, completely fitted for sea, called Numbers 10., supposed to be intended for a blockade-runner."

You will retain all the troops you have at Baldwin except the Eighth Regiment U. S. Colored Troops, which will be sent to this place immediately, and you will on no account send out Colonel Harris' command as directed by me yesterday. You will receive all your supplies at present from Camp Milton. All wagon trains you send to that place must be accompanied by a strong escort. General Birney has been ordered immediately to Hilton Head to give his testimony before a general court-martial and will start to-morrow. You will therefore be in command of this district.

Forces east side of Saint John's River:\n\nCOLONEL: The general commanding district directs me to say that he sends you the steamers Alice Price and Mary Benton. He wishes you to embark your command and reach the wharf at Jacksonville before daylight, so that the men may be disembarked without being observed, and bring with you every available man and every boat you can find. He further desires you to relieve the men on picket duty from Picolata to Jacksonville, that they and their boats may form part of the expedition. If this is found to be impracticable before daylight, let it be done after daylight, as that fact by itself will not excite suspicion. The general further directs that when you reach the wharf at Jacksonville you will move to a point within the fortifications, to bivouac until further orders. A staff officer will conduct you. The general hopes you will bring him at least 1,000 men. The general says if you cannot reach Jacksonville to-night in time to disembark before daylight to-morrow morning, you can wait till to-morrow night, but in that case you will send back the Alice Price immediately, and the general will send her to you again to-morrow night.\n\nI have the honor to be, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nJOHN C. GRAY, JR.,\n\nSecond Lieutenant and Aide-de-Camp."

General, Department of the South:\n\nI consider it my duty to lay before the major-general commanding the fact that two regiments of this command have not been paid since they entered the service of the United States, now one year ago. This unhappy state of affairs seems to have been brought about by some misunderstanding between the United States and the State of Massachusetts in regard to colored troops. For this misunderstanding the enlisted men cannot be held responsible, and they consequently should not be made to suffer for it.\n\nLetters have been constantly arriving for six months in these regiments, in which the wives of the enlisted men describe their sufferings and the sufferings of their families. Children have died because they could not be supplied with the proper food, and because the doctor could not be paid or medicines obtained from the druggist. Wives have proved untrue to their husbands and abandoned their offspring. Mothers advise their sons to throw down the muskets and come home, it being impossible for them to live longer without their support. The effect of such letters on the minds of the enlisted men of these regiments may be easily imagined, and it reflects to the credit of the officers as well as the men that the efficiency of the regiments has not materially suffered under these circumstances.\n\nI have ordered Colonel A. S. Hartwell, of the Fifty-fifth Massachusetts Volunteers, to explain the case personally to the general commanding, and to beg the general to send him north in order to procure an order from the Paymaster-General for the payment of these regiments as soon as possible, upon the law to that effect being passed. Sending the colonel north for that purpose would at least have the certain effect of keeping the men quiet while awaiting his return, and of convincing them that something was being done on their behalf which would prove decisive, whereas now many of them do not believe they will ever received any pay.\n\nI have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nA. SCHIMMELFENNIG,\n\nBrigadier-General, Commanding District."

The enemy pursued us with great vigor to this place, but, so far as I know, with cavalry alone.

I think the force you are now sending will suffice, as it is not possible for the enemy to send a large infantry force to this place over so destitute a country as we have just been over and in the present condition of the roads. Had our ammunition not been exhausted our loss would not have been so severe, except in material of war, and that could not be avoided in the present, execrable condition of the roads. We lost no artillery in battle, and yet were compelled to spike and destroy nearly all we had because it was impossible to drag it through the mud with animals so wasted in strength through want of forage.\n\nS.

Army,\n\nAssistant Adjutant-General, San Francisco, Cal.:\n\nSIR: I have to report that the communication with the troops under General Carleton is yet suspended. I received no express since my last report to you, thus making my latest dates from General Carleton the 4th of August. I cannot on any reasonable or satisfactory hypothesis account for the suspension of communication and why trains have not returned for subsistence. The general has not given my any instructions in regard to such a contingency. He intended to return about thirty wagons, as soon as unloaded, with forage, and I expected them to return from Mesilla, and some even from San Simon. I inclose a report* of means of transportation in possession of Captain Davis, chief of transportation. It will show that only six wagons and teams are here for replacing broken-down wagons and animals. Instead of this number of wagons and mules, General Carleton went off with the impresson that there were 200 mules, and wagons enough to use them in. I cannot well see how this miscalculation occured. All the trains sent to the Rio Grande he was aware of. Every commander of detachments had a list supplied of his transportation. The general could have known the exact state of the case before he left; he was in daily consultation with his chief of transportation, had his chief quartermaster with him, and certainly as soon as I was called upon to send forward 200 mules I undeceived him, and had a clear statement of the means of transportation sent to him, but I have no instructions how to act as yet. The inclosed extracts* of several letters written to General Carleton, through his acting assistant adjutant-general, will show you how much I am in the dark as respects this column, how I am placed in regard to receiving supplies from Fort Yuma, and the uncertainty in which I am in regard to what is in advance as well is in advance as well as in rear. Supplies for this Territory should not be mixed up with those for Fort Yuma, So long as they are, there will be delay, confusion, adn dissatisfaction, especially so long as the commander of that post ranks the commander of this district.\n\nI am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nD. FERGUSSON,\n\nMajor, First Cavalry California Volunteers, Commanding."

          "text": "HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF WESTER ARIZONA,\nTucson, Ariz. Ter., September 15, 1862.\n\nHis Excellency IGNACIO PESQUEIRA,\n\nGovernor of Sonora, Republic of Mexico, Ures, Sonora:\n\nYour Excellency I fear will think I am a troublesome neighbor. I have the honor to address you now on a subject of vital interest to Sonora and Arizona. Its importance is my apology for troubling you. Your Exellency will at once agree with me that the greatest enemy to the progress, prosperity, and development of these rich mineral, pastoral, and agricultural regions is the treacherous Apache. My object is to bring abot a perfect understanding, combined efforts, harmony of design, and unity of purpose between Your Excellency and your people and the authorities and inhabitants of this Territory, in regard to these Apaches, who have so long been the scourge and terror of Arizona and Sonora. I have been informed that several hundreds of Indians have been very lately in Fronteras, Sonora, making preparations for hostilities against the troops, citizens, residents, and travelers of Arizona, and that they even had the effrontery to send a deputation to Your Excellency, with the hopes of obtaining a treaty of peace, in order that they might with more impunity commit their atrocities in this Territory. I know the answer Your Excellency would make to such an infamous proposal, for you are well informed of their treachery and of the end they desire in asking for peace, though they would of course try to conceal it. I imagine I see Your Excellency rise in indignation and order the savage embassy that would dare to ask peace from the ruler of a people whose blood they have been wantonly shedding for over a century to be arrested. It appears to me, sir, that in view of the fact that there ae several towns on the fronties of Sonora, Frnteras, and Janos in particular, where Apaches rendezvous for the purpose of obtaining supplies of ammunition, &c., and of disposing of the effects of their murdered victims, it would cterests of Sonora and Arizona that the troops of either nation should have the right of following the barbarous enemy beyond the frontiers of the other. For my part, I would be very glad to see the troops of our sister Republic follow Apaches to any part of this Territory, and would respectfully ask of Your Excellency to grant to our troops the right to cross the frontiers of your State in pursuit of the inhuman enemies of civilization. It seems almost incredible that people claiming to be civilized should, as it is said the people of Fronteras and Janos do, allow their towns to be made cities of refuge and depots of supply ofr the wretched Indians whose sole object in life appears to be to rob, torture, and murder all who do not belong to their accursed tribes. It is said these people so far forget themselves as to give timely warning to the savages when danger threatens them. This, with the alleged fact that they furnish them the means of dealing death and destruction to their own people, their kindred and friends, puts them on a level with the Apaches. I am well infnormed of Your Excellency's sense of justice in regard to this subject, and realize and appreciate the obstacles and difficulties besetting your path in carrying out your designs in regard to the Apaches and their aiders and abettors on the frontiers. I am well persuaded that once an understanding is had between Your Excellency and the military authorities of this Territory in regard to the right of the troops of either nation crossing the frontiers of the other, the Apache race will cease to be formidable, and when it is convenient for the troops of both nations to act jointly against the common enemy, it will, in my opinion, be very desirable to do so. I submit these considerations to Your Excellency, with th ehope that you may agree with me, and that hereafter we may act as one against the enemy of both. I would also trouble Your Excellency on another subjewhen the troops of the Republic of Mexico were withdrawn from the Presidio of Tucson that the military commandant took the records of the town to Sonora with him. Many of the people here, being simple-minded persons, have not the proper titles to prove their right to property really belonging to them, having either failed to get written grants or having lost the evidences necessary to establish their claims. Many of the citizens of Sonora also have equitable claims difficult to establish. Without the records it will be impracticable to settel questions of titles to land, thus giving unprincipled men and advantage over honest men, who cannot establish their rights. Your Excellency would confer a great favor and further the ends of justice by ordering the return of the records referred to if they are not necessary for the archives of your State.\n\nI have the honor to be, sir, with sentiments of distinguished consideration and respect,\n\nD. FERGUSON,\n\nMajor, First Cavalry California Volunteers, Commanding."

RINEARSON,\n\nCommanding Officer Camp Lapwai, near Lewiston, Idaho Ter.:\n\nSIR: The object of this communication is again to enforce upon you the necessity of protecting the Indians from the aggressions of the whites. I am to-day informed by C. H. Hale, esq., superintendent of Indian affairs for Washington Territory, that the Nez Perce Indians have given their consent to the occupation of Lewiston and the other mining towns by the whites, but outside those towns it is especially desirable to enforce the provisions of the treaties and the United States laws intended for the protection of Indians in the Indian country. I desire you to afford to the Indian Department every assistance in your power for that purpose. In cases in which white men have squatted on the agricultural and grazing lands belonging to the reservation, contrary to the wishes of the Indians and the express prohibition of the agent, they should be removed. I desire you not to hesitate to break up any grogshops established in places which are evidently an encroachment upon the Indians and intended for the sale of liquor to the Indians. When the letter was sent to you from these headquarters on the 30th ultimo, in answer to your letter of the 10th ultimo, I was not aware that the grogshops spoken of were in places regarded as an encroachment on the Indians. I am satisfied that the military authorities, upon the request of the Indian agent, will be justified in removing or destroying any fences, houses, or improvements which constitute aggressions upon the Indians. You may also be asked to assist the civil authorities or the Indian Department in the arrest of men who have committed crimes and offenses against the Indians. You will, of course, be expected to exercise a sound discretion in such cases, as I do not wish the military power used for any purpose of oppression. In any offense against the Indian intercourse act the military forces may in all practicable cases be employed to assist the Indian Department. See section 23 of the act of 30th of June, 1834. They can be removed by your orders to Walla Walla, where they can be committed for trial before the civil authority. If a U. S. commissioner resides on the reservation who has authority to commit, your action should be, so far as possible, in obedience to his mandate, or of the marshal or acting marshal of the Territory. As stated in my instructions of the 18th of July, I have a personal interest in the Nez Perce Indians, whose friendship for the whites has for years been so conspicuous, and I shall therefore be much gratified if you can give them efficient aid and protection. Pray omit no fair opportunity of showing your wishes and intentions toward them. In any event which may possibly occur rendering a re-enforcement desirable, you must apply to Colonel J. Steinberger, commanding officer at Fort Walla Walla, for such aid, who has been instructed to furnish it. If he should himself at any time repair to your camp you will exhibit to him all your instructions and be governed by his orders. You may exhibit this letter, and also my instructions of 18th of July, to the Indian agent if you choose to do so.\n\nI am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nBENJ. ALVORD,\n\nBrigadier-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding District.\n\nP. S. -Please send me from time to time reports in detail of your proceedings.\n\nB. A."

DRUM,\n\nAssistant Adjutant-General, U. S. Army,\n\nHdqrs. Department of the Pacific, San Francisco, Cal.:\n\nMAJOR: I have the honor to report that I arrived here this morning at 12. 30. All things so far safe and right. I halted at my camp, some four to six miles northwest of Indian Well, until 4 p. m. of the 11th instant. The cavalry escort requested of Colonel bowie arrived in the night of the 10th instant. Since the overflow of the Colorado the whole face of this country has completely changed, and one who has traveled it before could hardly recognize it. I am perfectly satisfied that a plan was matured to attack this train, but the precautions taken so far have prevented anything of the kind. The desert is swarming with greasers, &c., and as there is plenty of water everywhere there would be no difficulty in forming a rendezvous at almost any point. I shall resume my march at noon to-day, and exepct to reach Fort Yuma to-morrow morning. I will notify you of the day when I shall leave that post. The further I progress the worse I find has been the management of this road, and it is only surprising that many of the vedettes have not deserted. The first desertion has yet to be chronicled. Two men (Connelly and Getchell) of Company D, Second Cavalry California Volunteers, Captain McLaughlin, stationed at Camp Wright, Cal., guarding quartermaster's and commissary stores, are supposed to have deserted a few days since. The vedette is hourly expected.\n\nI am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nWILLIAM G. MORRIS,\n\nCaptain and Assistant Quartermaster, U. S. Army."

          "text": "Fort Ruby, September 14, 1862.\n\nMajor R. C. DRUM,\n\nAssistant Adjutant-General, San Francisco, Cal.:\n\nMAJOR: I have th ehonor to report my return to this post from Salt Lake last evening. I am glad I made the journey, as it will be the means of saving my command much suffering for want of water. The country between this point and Salt Lake is an alkali desert, scarce of wood and water, but I have made such arrangements as will enable me to take my command over with comparative comfort. It will be impossible for me to describe what I saw and heard in Salt Lake, so as to make you realize the enormity of Mormonism; suffice it, that I found them a community of traitors, murderers, fanatics, and whores. The people publicly rejoice at reverses to our arms, and thank God that the American Government is gone, as they term it, while their prophet and bishops preach treason from the pulpit. The Federal officers are entirely powerless, and talk in whispers for fear of being overheard by Brigham's spies. Brigham Young rules with despotic sway, and death by assassination is the penalty of disobedience to his commands. I have a difficult and dangerous task before me, and will endeavor to act with prudence and firmness.\n\nI examined the country in the vicinity of the city to find a suitable location for a post. Fort Crittenden (Camp Floyd) is in ruins, except the few buildings, of which I send you a description, and for which the owner asks $15,000. * There are also some buildings purchased by and belonging to the Overland Mail Company, and now occupied by them, but which are not for sale. of the remaining buildings there is nothing left but the adobes, except two or three buildings owned by former sutlers, which are in tolerable repair, and could be purchased cheap. If it were designed to establish a permanent post, most of the buildings would have to be torn down and removed, as many of them are half a mile from the officers' quarters, or what was known as headquarters. The latter buildings are the only ones in tolerable repair; the others require doors, windows, work to place them in habitable order. The land is considered a Government reserve, but the post is badly located, being on the edge of the reserve and adjoining a small village, inhabited by a class of persons of questionable character. There is good grazing on the reserve, which is the only redeeming quality, in my opinion, it has. There are sufficient adobes on the ground to erect such additional buildings as I may require, but good timber is scarce, and the saw-mills are sixty miles distant.\n\nI found another location, which I like better for various reasons, which I shall explain. It is on a plateau about three miles from Salt Lake City; in the vicinity of good timber and saw-mills, and at a point where hay, grain, and othe produce can be purchased cheaper than at Fort Crittenden. It is also a point which commands the city, and where 1,000 troops would be more efficient than 3,000 on the other side of the Jordan. If the general decides that I shall locate there, I intend to quietly intrench my position, and then say to the Saints of Utah, enough of your treason; but if it is intended that I shall merely protect the overland mail and permit the Mormons to act and utter treason, then I had as well locate at Crittenden. The Federal officers desire and beg that I will locate near the city. The Governor especially is very urgent in the matter. It is certainly rather late in the season to build quarters, but I believe I could make my command comfortable before very cold weather sets in. It is raining here now, and snowing on the surrounding mountains. It is important that I should know the general's decision as soon as possible, as winter is fast approaching. Communication by mail or tlegraph will, until my arrival at Salt Lake, reach me earlier by being directed to Ruby Valley than to any other point.\n\nI have the honor to remain, your obedient servant,\n\nP. EDW. CONNOR,\n\nColonel Third Infty. California Vols., Commanding District of Utah."
