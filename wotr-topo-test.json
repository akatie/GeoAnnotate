It seems to me that your first plan of proposed operations is the best; but, inasmuch as Johnston will be compelled to hold a large part of his force in Buzzard Roost Gap as long as it is threatened, Hooker's corp might be sent at once to re-enforce General McPherson, whilst General Palmer's corps could be placed in reserve, to march at a moment's notice, and Howard's Corps placed in position to defend the gap and hold the enemy in check. In the mean time the depot could be withdrawn to Ringgold, and to-morrow night General Schofield's command take position in front of Ringgold and in the gap, with General Stoneman's cavalry covering its front, whilst Palmer's and Howard's corps could march as you suggest by the main Mill Creek road to Villanow, sending their wagons by the Trickum road, covering their movement with McCook's cavalry, which can afterward occupy Villanow and Ship's Gap, and securing our communications with Ringgold.\n\nVery respectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nGEO.

SHERMAN,\n\nCommanding Military Division of the Mississippi:\n\nGENERAL: We met one brigade of rebel cavalry shortly after we emerged from the gap this morning; drove them back after a slight skirmish. Dodge's advance must be within two miles of Resaca by this time. The cavalry which we met here was part of Wheeler's. Prisoners say they left Dalton at 10 p. m. last night and expected to get possession of the gap. We were a little too quick for them. I cannot find out whether there is any considerable force of infantry at Resaca or not. Will know soon. Few houses along the road and no one at home, except women and children. Country densely wooded. Is impossible to communicate with General Hooker by signals, owing to the rough, impracticable nature of the country and the dense foliage. I propose to cut the railroad, if possible, and then fall back and take a strong position near the gorge on this [side] of the mountain and await your orders. I wrote to General Hooker to control the road across the mountain from Dalton, about six miles north of Snake Creek Gap.\n\nVery respectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nJAS. B.

According to his instructions, he drew back to the debouches of the gorge, where he has a strong defensive position, and guards the only pass into the valley of the Oostenaula available to us. Buzzard Roost Gap, through which the railroad passes, is naturally and artificially too strong to be attempted. I must feign on Buzzard Roost, but pass through Snake Creek Gap, and place myself between Johnston and Resaca, when we will have to fight it out. I am making the preliminary move. Certain that Johnston can make no detachments, I will be in no hurry. My cavalry is just approaching from Kentucky and Tennessee (detained by the difficulty of getting horse), and even now it is less than my minimum.\n\nW. T. SHERMAN,\n\nMajor-General.",

          "text": "Numbers 4. Report of Brigadier General Henry E. Davies, jr., U. S. Army, commanding First Brigade, Third Division, Cavalry Corps.\n\nHEADQUARTERS FIRST BRIGADE, THIRD DIVISION, Stevensburg, Va., April 4, 1864.\n\nLIEUTENANT: Pursuant to orders received this a. m. from division headquarters, I have the honor to forward the following report of the operations of my command on the recent raid to Richmond:\n\nOn the 28th day of February a detachment of the First Division, Cavalry Corps, commanded by Major Hall, Sixth New York Cavalry, reported to me, consisting of detachments from various regiments of that division, in all amounting to 34 commissioned officers and 697 enlisted men; a detachment of the Second Division, Cavalry Corps, commanded by Major Taylor, First Maine Cavalry, also reported to me, consisting of detachments form various regiments of that division, in all amounting to 19 commissioned officers and 472 enlisted men. I took on the 28th from my own brigade (First Brigade, Third Division) the men who were well mounted, amounting in all to 27 commissioned officers and 568 enlisted men, giving me when we moved a total of 80 commissioned officers and 1,737 enlisted men. From this force, before the movement of the main body of the expedition, I detached the following parties to report to Colonel Dahlgren: Second New York Cavalry, 100 men; Fifth New York Cavalry, 40 men; detachment Second Division, 150 men; making a total of 290 men. This detachment was under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel [Major] Cooke, Second New York Cavalry.\n\nMy command left their camps at Stevensburg shortly after dark on the evening of February 28, marched to Ely's Ford on the Rapidan, and crossed at that point; thence on through Spotsylvania Court-House, on the morning of the 29th of February, and across the Po River. Here a halt of about an hour was made to feed. The brigade then moved forward through Mount Pleasant, New Market, and Chilesburg to the North Anna River. This steam was crossed at Anderson's Ford, and I reached Beaver Dam Station between 3 and 4 p. m. Here the railroad depot, water-tanks, store-house, &c., burned, the telegraph cut, and the poles taken down for a considerable distance. An attempt was made to capture as railroad train that was heard approaching from Richmond, but taking alarm from the burning buildings at the station, it succeeded in backing out of the way before my men could reach it. A slight skirmish occurred here between my advanced guard and some 25 dismounted men of the enemy, who fired a volley and then made their escape in the woods. The command moved from Beaver Dam some 6 miles on the road to Guard Squirrel Bridge, and went into camp about 8 p. m.\n\nAt 11 p. m. Major Hall, Sixth New York Cavalry, with a detail of 450 men form the First Division detachment, was sent to make an attack on the South Anna railroad bridge, and between 12 p. m. and 1 a. m. of the 1st day of March my command moved out of camp and took the road to Richmond. Before reaching the South Anna my advanced guard met and drove from position a small force of the enemy's infantry, who appeared to be on picket duty. The South Anna River was crossed at daylight at a bridge about 2 miles west of the Richmond and Fredericksburg Railroad, and a short halt made to enable the division to close up. I then moved toward Richmond, passing Ashland Station about a mile to my left, and crossing the Richmond and Fredericksburg Railroad some 2 miles below Ashland. At this point the telegraph and railroad were destroyed, and a party sent, in charge of Lieutenant Whitaker, aide-de-camp on the staff of the general commanding division, to destroy a bridge on the line of the road, which object I believe was accomplished.\n\nThe brigade then moved forward to and crossed and brought in, and from that time we constantly fell in with small parties of the enemy, apparently sent out for the purpose of observing our movements, several of whom were captured.\n\nAt the bridge on the turnpike, where it crosses the brook, a few of the enemy were met, who immediately retreated on the appearance of my advanced guard, who made 2 or 3 prisoners, and several who had hidden in the woods came out and gave themselves up.\n\nThe first line of works that we was on the south side of the brook, commanding the bridge and the ford, but were not manned. After crossing the brook my column moved forward on the pike, encountering no resistance until about 1 p. m., when they came within sight of a line of earth-works, stretching to the right and left of the road 2 miles from the brook, from which the enemy immediately opened with artillery. The position that they occupied was a good me. The county for 1,000 yards in front of the works was open and perfectly level, affording no cover or position whence our artillery could be used to any advantage. The approach by the road was defended by a section of artillery, having a perfect range of the whole ground, and also enfiladed by the fire of two guns on our right and four on our left, and it was impracticable from the nature of the ground to maneuver cavalry on either side of the road except as skirmishers, the fields being very soft and muddy, and intersected with wide and deep ditches.\n\nI ordered the Fifth New York Cavalry to deploy as skirmishers on the right and left of the road, and to advance as far as practicable toward the enemy, and gave directions for the rest of my command to form, while I went forward to examine the ground. i concluded that the best method of attack would be to send forward a strong party of dismounted men on the left of the road, where they could for some distance be kept out of view by some houses that stood on that side of the road, and when they were well engaged to make a attack down the road covered by our artillery. An attacking force of 500 men taken from the different regiments of the command, armed with carbines, was formed and placed under the orders of Major Patton, Third Indiana Cavalry, who was instructed to keep well to the left and make a determined attack upon the earthworks on that side, and to gain, if possible, a position where he could bring his fire to bear upon the enemy's guns. The rest of the command with the exception of the Fifth New York Cavalry, who were deployed and had been ordered to advance simultaneously with Major Patton, were formed ready to charge as soon as the diversion I had intended could be effected.\n\nMajor Patton advanced with his men, and as soon as he got within range the enemy in considerable force opened upon him with musketry. I was soon afterward directed by the general commanding division to withdraw my men and take the road to the Meadow Bridges, covering the rear of the division. Major Patton, on coming back, reported that the enemy had exhibited a considerable any certainty what number he observed. The enemy on the falling back of my command threw out form their works about 200 infantry skirmishers, who were checked by my rear guard and make no further demonstrations.\n\nAs we were moving on the road to the Meadow Bridges Major Hall, who had been detached the previous night to attack the South Anna railroad bridge, rejoined my command, reporting that he had found the bridge, rejoined my command, reporting that he had found the bridges strongly with infantry and artillery, and he could not accomplish the objected for which he was sent.\n\nI moved down the road to the Meadow Bridges, setting fire to the railway trestle-work at that place and destroying the road bridges after I had crossed, and went into camp near Mechanicsville, picketing in my rear and on both flanks.\n\nThe enemy during the evening skirmished slightly with my pickets, and about 12 p. m. attacked the Second Brigade in force. My command at once mounted and formed, but the Second Brigade in force. My command at once mounted and formed, but the Second Brigade, unassisted, repulsed the attack made on them, and I moved to the vicinity of Old Church, which was reached about 4 a. m. on the morning of the 2nd of March. About 8 a. m. I moved my command about 1 mile beyond Old Church, and there took up a position. The enemy's cavalry in small force appeared, but were instantly put to flight by a squadron of the First Maine Cavalry, which drove them at the first attack. I then moved on the the vicinity of Tunstall's Station, where the brigade encamped for the night. While on the road this day I was overtaken by Captain Mitchell, Second New York Cavalry, who brought in about 250 of the men who had been sent on the expedition intrusted to Colonel Dahlgren.\n\nThe next morning, March 3, I moved on the Williamsburg road, meeting a short distance from the station a portion of the command sent up by Major-General Butler to New Kent Court-House. I marched through New Kent Court-House that day as far as the Twelve-Mile Ordinary, where I went into camp for the night.\n\nThe following day, March 4, I marched through Williamsburg to Yorktown, where I went into camp in the afternoon.\n\nOn Saturday evening, March 5, pursuant to orders from division headquarters, I ordered Major Hall with 400 men to march to Newport News, there to embark on transports for Portsmouth, Va., while with 400 more men of the command I embarked at Yorktown on transports for Portsmouth. The whole command reached Portsmouth about 11 a. m. on Sunday, March 6, and after moving out from the town it was found that the emergency that required our presence no longer existed. I therefore went into camp near Portsmouth that evening.\n\nThe following two days, March 7 and 8, were occupied in shipping the men and horses back to Yorktown, where I returned on the afternoon of the 8th of March.\n\nWednesday, March 9, I received orders to embark my brigade on transports to return to the Army of the Potomac, landing at Alexandria. I reached Alexandria on the morning of March 10, and the same day the Fifth New York Cavalry and Ransom's battery, with detachments from other regiments, arrived there.\n\nMarch 11, the Fifth New York Cavalry started for Stevensburg, which they reached on the evening of the 12th.\n\nOn the 11th the whole of the Second New York and Eighteenth Pennsylvania Cavalry and a portion of the detachment from the Second Division reached Alexandria. These men, together with the battery, were sent forward to the Army of the Potomac on the 12th of March, under command of Colonel Bryan, Eighteenth Pennsylvania Cavalry, and reached their camps on the morning of the 14th. The remainder of the Second Division detachment reached Alexandria on the 12th, and moved out to rejoin their command on the morning of the 13th, and the detachment from the First Division reaching Alexandria on the 13th moved on the 14th to their former headquarters.\n\nI believe that the above will include all the movements of the force under my command on the late expedition.\n\nI have already forwarded to division headquarters nominal and numerical lists of killed, wounded, and missing, as well as of property, &c., lost and captured.\n\nRespectfully submitted.\n\nH. E. DAVIES, JR.,\n\nBrigadier-General, Commanding.\n\nLieutenant E. W. WHITAKER,\n\nActing Assistant Adjutant-General."

Here the column halted while a detachment from the One hundred and twenty-fifth New York Volunteers, led by Captain R. S. Seabury, assistant adjutant-general Third Brigade, was sent forward to seize the ford and force a passage, which having been accomplished, the column moved forward and effected a crossing with considerable difficulty, owing to the strong current and depth of water (which reached the waists of the men) and the steep and slippery banks. After crossing, the regiment moved forward with the brigade and took possession of an eminence about three-fourths of a mile southeast from the ford, on which were a house and out-buildings. We were ordered, in case of an attack, to occupy and hold this house and out-buildings at all hazards. About 3 p. m. the regiment was ordered to support that portion of the skirmish line held by the Thirty-ninth New York Volunteers on the left of our line. The regiment remained in position as a reserve until about 5 p. m., when the skirmishers of the enemy, having been heavily re-enforced, moved forward and commenced a rapid firing. The regiment immediately deployed and returned the fire with such effect that though the enemy outnumbered us 3 to 1 his advance was stopped, and he was held in check until night put an end to the conflict. About midnight, in obedience to orders received through Colonel Crandell, of the One hundred and twenty-fifth New York Volunteers, I withdrew the regiment and recrossed the Rapidan.\n\nThroughout the whole affair the conduct of both officers and men was such as to merit my highest approbation. Though suffering severely from cold, wet, and fatigue they performed every duty and faced danger with a zeal and courage worthy of their past reputation. Although subjected from the commencement to the end of the fight to an enfilading fire from the right and left, besides a direct fire from the front, our loss was only 1 wounded and 2 missing.\n\nI am, captain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nI. M. LUSK,\n\nLieutenant-Colonel, Commanding 111th New York Volunteers."

THIRTY-NINTH REGIMENT NEW YORK VOLS.,\nFebruary 9, 1864.\n\nSIR: I have the honor to report the part this regiment (Thirty-ninth New York Volunteers) took in the reconnaissance of the 6th day of February, 1864:\n\nThe regiment left camp on the 6th instant at 7 a. m., with 18 officers and 390 men under my command. I detailed Captains Baer and Schwickardi to command all the old soldiers of the regiment (100 in number) as skirmishers to cross the Rapidan River, which they did in gallant style, driving the enemy from their rifle-pits and capturing 15 prisoners. The regiment was the second to form line on the opposite side of the river. It marched in line of battle to within gunshot of the enemy's skirmishers. About 12 m. I changed front to the right and took position on the Morton's Ford road. About 5 p. m. I was ordered to form line of battle to the right of General Hays' headquarters, under a heavy fire of the enemy, which was done very promptly considering that the men under my command were never under fire before and not two months in service.\n\nMy loss was 1 enlisted man killed, 17 wounded, and 17 missing. Lieutenant L. Derndinger was severely wounded in the left arm while on the skirmish line.\n\nI take pleasure in making honorable mention of First Lieutenant John McE. Hyde, acting adjutant of the regiment, who rendered me excellent service on the field; also Captains Baer and Schwickardi and Lieutenant Derndinger, for gallantry; also Chief Bugler Anton Rang, for bravery on the skirmish line. I recrossed the Rapidan at 1 a. m. next day.\n\nI have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nJAMES G. HUGHES,\n\nLieutenant Colonel, Commanding Thirty-ninth New York Volunteers."

Report of Colonel Levin Crandell, One hundred and twenty-fifth New York Infantry.\n\nHEADQUARTERS 125TH NEW YORK VOLUNTEERS,\nFebruary 9, 1864.\n\nSIR: I have the honor to make the following report of the part taken by the One hundred and twenty-fifth Regiment New York Volunteers, in the reconnaissance made by the Second Corps on the 6th instant:\n\nOrders to be in readiness to march at 7 o'clock were received on the morning of the 6th instant at about 4. 30 o'clock. The regiment was in readiness and took up the march promptly at 7 o'clock; arrived at the cavalry camp, near Morton's Ford, on the Rapidan, at 10. 30 a. m. ; there was ordered to furnish 100 men to lead as skirmishers across the ford. One hundred non-commissioned officers and men were furnished, together with the following commissioned officers, who accompanied the skirmishers, to wit: Captain John Quay, Lieutenant E. B. Hull, Lieutenant B. G. Barto, Lieutenant E. O'Connor, Lieutenant M. B. Miller, and Lieutenant E. S. P. Clapp. The skirmishers advanced and crossed Morton's Ford at 11 o'clock, gallantry led by Captain R. S. Seabury, assistant adjutant-general, who was the first to cross the stream. The enemy's pickets, to the number of 60 to 80 men, lay intrenched on the opposite bank of the stream, within short range of the ford. They opened a brisk fire on the skirmishers, but effected nothing. Immediately on crossing the ford they captured and took 27 men and 2 commissioned officers prisoners; were then immediately deployed and advanced, skirmishing to the left of the ford, driving the enemy into their intrenchments, and remained in that position, skirmishing briskly at intervals, from that time until 1 o'clock the next morning, when they were ordered to withdraw from the line and recross the ford, which was done in good order. That portion of the regiment not detached as skirmishers was kept in supporting distance of the line until about dusk, the time of the general attack, when it moved forward to the skirmish line and took part in the skirmish.\n\nFour were slightly wounded; not so as to disable them in any way, however. Both officers and men behaved admirably. In not a single instance can my exceptions be taken to the conduct of either officers or men.\n\nI am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nLEVIN CRANDELL,\n\nColonel 125th Regiment New York Volunteers."

ARTILLERY Brigadier, SECOND ARMY CORPS,\nFebruary 11, 1864.\n\nCOLONEL: I respectfully forward the following report of operations of the Artillery Brigade the 6th and 7th instant:\n\nIn accordance with circular dated February 6, 1864, three batteries of the brigade - Arnold's (Battery A, First Rhode Island Light Artillery), Thompson's (Battery C, Independent Pennsylvania Artillery), Rickett's (Battery F, First Pennsylvania Artillery), temporarily under the command of Lieutenant Spence - moved from camp and joined the column near the headquarters of the Third Division. Upon arriving near Morton's Ford, Arnold's and Thompson's batteries were placed in favorable positions on the left bank of the river and above the ford, and one section of Spence's battery (the other two sections being held in reserve) sent under the command of Lieutenant Mitchell about a mile below, where it was placed in position near Stringfellow's house by Lieutenant Roebling, aide-de-camp to the commanding general. About 4. 30 p. m. on the evening of the 6th Captain Arnold fired 42 shells into the enemy's works, with good effect.\n\nOn the morning of the 7th I arose at daybreak, and was surprised to find that the infantry had recrossed the river, not having been informed that the movement had taken place. Lieutenant Goddard was at once sent to withdraw the section near Stringfellow's house, but just as he arrived there the enemy's sharpshooters advanced to the bank, about 250 yards distant on the opposite side of the river, and opened an extremely sharp fire on the section, severely wounding 1 man, Private Frederick Batts. Lieutenant Mitchell, being unaware that the infantry had recrossed the river, mistook the enemy for our own men and allowed them to approach the river without withdrawing his section. At this time the regiment of infantry, which was there for the support of the section, was several hundred yards to the rear and out of supporting distance. Lieutenant Mitchell at once ordered the guns to be limbered to the rear, but the horses attacked to one of the limbers becoming unmanageable, ran away, causing some confusion. So sharp was the enemy's fire that it was impossible to withdraw the guns at once, but the infantry quickly advanced and the pieces were drawn to the rear under their cover, placed in a favorable position, and a few shells fired with effect. The batteries were not employed through the day, and at night returned to camp.\n\nI am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nJ. ALBERT MORNOE,\n\nLieutenant-Colonel and Chief of Artillery."

I will send a full report of my operations. My command is now being fed. I will report of my operations. My command is now be very much worn. I found Charlottesville and the brigade over the Rivanna guarded by four batteries of artillery, two brigades of cavalry, and a very large force of infantry. This will be sufficient reason for my not having destroyed the railroad bridge, but I destroyed the fine frame bridge over that steam, within 2 miles of the railroad; captured and destroyed a large camp of the enemy,\nafter driving them from it; captured 6 caissons loaded with ammunition, 2 forges, and harness for both caissons and forges; burnt 3 large flouring mills filled with grain; captured 1 standard bearing the Virginia State arms; captured about 500 horses, 2 Government wagons, one loaded with bacon, and on my return was cut off by a large force of cavalry and artillery under Generals Stuart and Wickham. My command cut its way through without losing a man, except a few wounded. The enemy had several killed,a large number wounded, and we captured over 50 prisoners. Since yesterday morning I have marched 100 miles.\n\nVery respectfully,\n\nG. A. CUSTER,\n\nBrigadier-General."

SECOND DIVISION, SECOND ARMY CORPS,\nFebruary 13, 1864.\n\nCOLONEL: I have the honor to report that this division left its camp at 8. 30 a. m. on the 6th instant, having been ready to march at 7 a. m. Proceeding to Morton's Ford, it was held in reserve, by order of Brigadier-General Caldwell, before and during the engagement of the Third Division with the enemy. At about 6 p. m. Major-General Warren directed that one brigade of this division should re-enforce Brigadier-General Hays. The First Brigade was detailed for this duty, and was posted on the right of Colonel Carroll's brigade, by about 6. 30 p. m., losing 2 men wounded in crossing the rough bridge built during the day. At 7 p. m. the remainder of the division was ordered over the Rapidan, and by 8 o'clock had been reported to Brigadier-General Hays by myself and posted to support his line. My own headquarters was established with General hays in the house on the left of his line. At about 10 p. m. Major-General Warren ordered that the picket-line should be relieved by this division, and the First Brigade, Colonel Baxter commanding, was directed to deploy to the front for this purpose, and to relieve the entire line. As it was very dark this movement required some two hours, and a part of General Hays' line (the pickets of General Owen's brigade) was not relieved by Colonel Baxter, since it was reported that the brigade would not cover the whole of the front. In accordance with the directions of the major-general commanding, I directed Colonel Baxter to relieve his whole line, gradually withdrawing his command to the other side of the river, and leaving but 75 men to keep up a semblance of a picket-line. At about 12 o'clock across the river. At 1. 15 it was reported to me that all were in and forced my semblance of a picket-line to retire in haste. The command returned to this camp on the night of Sunday, the 7th instant.\n\nI have the honor to remain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nALEX. S. WEBB,\n\nBrigadier-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding Division."

S. Army. Lieutenant Vertegans, of the same regiment, of whom the major speaks in complimentary terms, will start to-morrow for Richmond with Brigadier-General Scammon and the 2 officers of his staff- Lieutenants Pinckard and Millward. Major Nounnan and his small party, especially Lieutenant Vertegans, have performed their duty in the most creditable manner.\n\nI sent Colonel Ferguson with his regiment (the Sixteenth Virginia Cavalry) to the Lower Kanawha late in December last. He has so far conducted the expedition with judgment and discretion; has captured much of the enemy's property and a number of prisoners, and diverted the attention of the enemy in that quarter from this part of the country to the protection of their own border.\n\nVery respectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nSAM. JONES,\n\nMajor-General."

          "text": "Colonel R. H. CHILTON,\n\nChief of Staff.\n\nNumbers 3. Synopsis of testimony as to robbery of the passengers. *\n\nHYMAN ROBBERY.\n\nThe first proof is a letter from Mr. Phil. Williams, of Winchester, a very prominent citizen, whom Hyman consulted on his arrival at that place. The letter is to General Early, and is dated February 15, 1864. It contains Hyman's version of the robbery. Hymman says that as he passed a brick house on the west side of road near Woodstock (north of it), he saw 7 Confederate cavalry; at Fisher's Hill. Hyman had two wagons, driven by two sons of Mr. Cross, of Newtown, and there was a young man in one of them named Grove, also of Newtown, who remarked as the men passed, \"There goes Cherry. \" (Grove subsequently denied having made to remarks.) There was also with Hyman a boy of about seventeen years of age named Ezekiel, from Richmond. The men halted at the foot of the hill near the river, and one of them rode back to the wagons and asked Hyman if he had any pursue. Hyman gave him a small purse with ten gold dollars and some paper money, when the man said to him that he had a belts, and while he was trying to get off one without showing the other was knocked down and robbed of about $6,000 in gold (chiefly twenty-dollar pieces), a silver watch, a great coat (invisible green with yellow silk sleeve linings), in the pocket of which was a fur collar and a small Hebrew prayer-book. There was taken from young Ezekiel a lady's gold watch and a belt containing a number of silver coins and medals.\n\nIt appears from the letter of Colonel Carrington, provost-marshal at Richmond, that soon after the robbery General Winder sent two detectives to the valley to investigate the matter, at the request of the father of Ezekiel. These detectives reported that they were convinced that Cherry and some other men committed the robbery; that they determined to arrest Cherry, and were piloted by a negro 6 miles beyond Strasburg in search of him. Fearing foul play they turned back, but on searching the negro found on him the watch stolen from young Ezekiel, which was subsequently identified by his father. They did not bring off the negro because they said they were afraid to encumber themselves with him. It should be mentioned that the detective got Mr. Williams' letter from General Early before they went down the valley.\n\nOn March 9, 1864, a letter was written by a Major E. W. Cross from Harrisonburg to Colonel Carrington, in which he charges that the detectives did find out the guilty parties but were bribed to say nothing. Cross says that he had examined some of the money said to have been taken at the railroad robbery, but that all was marked in a peculiar manner. (In Mr. Williams' letter it was stated that the stolen money was marked.) Cross further says that the perpetrators were generally known in the vicinity of Harrisonburg. He gives the names of a number of persons who can show some of the money. He also state that Major Gilmor, while under the influence of liquor, had boasted that he had arranged the whole affair. He says he can name every man concerned but could not prove the fact, but gives the names of others who can; also states that Gilmor had boasted that he had arranged the matter with the detectives, and could manage the whole detective force of the Government.\n\nThe papers above referred to were sent by the department to General Imboden, with orders to investigate the whole matter. The proof obtained by General Imboden was as follows:\n\nCaptain Owings, quartermaster of Gilmor's battalion, states that Gilmor gave him $160 in gold to buy a horse with, and told him that most of it was taken from a Jew, and that he had arranged the affair, though he did not take the money personally. Gilmor stated that Cherry, Martin, and others were engaged; other names not remembered. The robbery took place below Harrisonburg. The conversation took place son after Gilmor's return from the railroad expedition. Gilmore was in liquor when the conversation occurred.\n\nCaptain Ross, of Gilmor's battalion, testifies that he conversed with several of the men engaged in the railroad robbery, who told him they got no gold. He talked with Martin, and told him that if he had had anything to do with robbing the Jew named Hyman he had better make a clean breast of it. Martin said that he met Major Gilmor near Fisher's Hill with other men not recognized. He did not know Gilmor until the latter hailed him, nor was Gilmor riding his own horse. Gilmor ordered Martin with some others to follow a wagon then near to a certain place, and take out two boys named Cross and remove them out of sight of the wagon. The wagon contained Jews. Martin's share of the gold was about $800. Gilmor acknowledged to Captain Ross that he had arranged the affair of robbing the Jew; had put the men concerned all right, and had stood off and seen the thing well done.\n\nQuartermaster-Sergeant Gorsuch, of Gilmor's battalion, testifies that the men got but little gold, if any, from the railroad.\n\nPrivate John Bosley, Company C, Gilmor's battalion, told Gorsuch that he had seen a pile of gold in the possession of Major Gilmor.\n\nPrivate Todd, of Company C, told Bosley that he (Todd) had received about $800, and also that Major Gilmor, Cherry, Mel. Todd, Martin, and one man in McNeill's company were engaged in robbing they Jew. Bosley also stated that Martin had given more than $500 to Cherry's mother, in Staunton.\n\nPrivate Harding, Company C, testifies that he stopped all night below Woodstock the day after the railroad affair, and that the next morning he met Gilmor, ex-Lieutenant Billings, and Snodgrass, with two or three others, going down the valley, and a man remarked that he would \"bet the major was on the make now. \"\n\nLieutenant Kemp testifies that he heard Cherry say that he had placed some money in the hands of Todd; do not know how much. Heard Major Gilmor say that he was not there, or that they would not catch him in the affair; does not remember the words.\n\nIn Major Gilmor's report of the attack on the railroad he says Cherry was present, but he was aware of it until after the affair was over.\n\nRAILROAD ROBBERY.\n\nGilmor's report state the reasons why he did not bring off the prisoners taken in the cars. Alleges that the robbery of the passengers was without his knowledge and against his orders. States that he took about $900 in greenbacks from the mail-bags. That when the train was first attacked he went to get in the express car to break open the safe, but went into the smoking-car by mistake. The robbery took place while he was engaged in the express and smoking car, where one of the passengers attacked him. The report shows that the principal attention was given to plunder.\n\nSergeant Levy, Company B, testifies that Gilmor gave orders the evening before not to molest citizens were robbed the robber should be shot. More robberies were committed.\n\nQuartermaster Sergeant Gorsuch proves that men who were on the expedition admitted that they robbed citizens, except those in the ladies's car. Pistols, money, and clothing were taken.\n\nPrivate Bosley testifies to the admissions of men engaged on the railroad that they had robbed passengers. One man took a watch from a lady.\n\nPrivate harding testifies that they were ordered not to take anything from the employes of the railroad, but understood they might take from citizens. He remonstrated against the proceeding, and told Gilmor there were so good Southern men as himself in the train. One man got $13 in gold and silver. Gilmor told them they might take anything form the conductor or from the express agent."

FIRST DIVISION, SECOND ARMY CORPS,\nMarch 22, 1864.\n\nCOLONEL: I have the honor to submit the following report of the operations of my command on the 6th of 7th of February last:\n\nIn obedience to orders from headquarters Second Corps, my division moved toward Morton's Ford at 7 o'clock on the morning of the 6th. When within 1 mile of the ford I was informed by Lieutenant-Colonel Walker, assistant adjutant-general of the corps, that Major-General Warren was unable to leave his quarters on account of sickness, and that the command of the corps devolved upon me. The instructions which he then showed me directed that the Second Corps should move to Morton's Ford and make a demonstration during the 6th, 7th, and 8th. On riding forward to reconnoiter I found that the enemy had a picket-line along the river, and a force of 30 or more men in rifle-pits directly at the ford. I directed Brigadier-General Hays, commanding Third Division, to send a brigade across the river at the ford and to advance it half a mile beyond. This was done in the most gallant manner, and nearly the whole force at the ford was captured without the loss of a man. This brigade then advanced with little opposition to a ridge about three-quarters of a mile from the river, where it halted about a rifle-shot from the enemy's intrenchments. The enemy making a considerable show of force in front of General Owen's brigade, at the request of General Hays the two remaining brigades of the Third Division were sent across the river.\n\nUnderstanding as I did that the orders from army headquarters were not to precipitate an engagement, but to draw a large force of the enemy to our front, I determined not to advance farther, but to hold our position. To accomplish this I made the following disposition: The left of the Third Division rested near the river opposite Stringfellow's house, but the right was on open ground at some distance from the river. To protect the right, which was much the weakest in infantry, the rifled batteries of Captains Thompson and Arnold were placed in position on the high ground near the river bank, so as to cover completely with their fire any approach of the enemy on our right. A section of Captain Ricketts' battery, supported by a regiment of infantry, was placed in position near Stringfellow's house, so as to enfilade any force advancing against our left. The other four guns of Captain Ricketts were placed behind the crest near Captain Arnold's position, ready to come into battery at any moment if needed. At the same time the Second Division, Brigadier-General Webb, commanding, was advanced to within a short distance of the river, while the First Division was in the edge of the woods.\n\nBetween 4 and 5 o'clock in the afternoon Major-General Warren arrived on the ground and took command of the corps. I resumed command of my division, and by command of General Warren sent the remainder of the First Brigade to the support of the section of artillery at Stringfellow's house.\n\nDuring the 7th my division was not engaged, and at sunset we returned to camp.\n\nThe gallantry of General Hays, whose division did all the fighting, was conspicuous. His report will doubtless give you a list of his officers who distinguished themselves. If the object of our movement was to make a demonstration merely, and cause the enemy to mass a large force in our front, I am confident it was entirely successful.\n\nI am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nJOHN C. CALDWELL,\n\nBrigadier General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding First Division."

Kester, First New Jersey Cavalry.\n\nHEADQUARTERS FIRST NEW JERSEY CAVALRY, February 19, 1864.\n\nCAPTAIN: I have the honor to report that, in obedience to instructions, I started from Warrenton with 350 men, comprising the following commands: One hundred and fifty, First New Jersey; 100, First Pennsylvania; 50, Third Pennsylvania, and 50, First Massachusetts. It being very cold I marched rapidly, and at Salem I sent Lieutenant Bradbury, Third Pennsylvania, with 50 men of the First Massachusetts, to pass through Upperville and meet the rest of the command at Paris, in Ashby's Gap. I took the main column on the Peidmont. At that point I sent Captain Hart with 150 men of the First New Jersey Cavalry to pass through Peidmont Valley and stop at Paris until I arrived. With 100 men of the First Pennsylvania, under Captain McGregor, and 50 men of the Third Pennsylvania, under Captain Wetherill, I marched to Markham Station in Manassas Gap. From that point I crossed the mountains by a by-path, and joined the other parties at Paris at 12 o'clock on the day of the 18th. The column under Lieutenant Bradbury lost their way and came into Paris without passing through Upperville, and captured some horses and arms without seeing any of the enemy. The column under Captain Hart passed through Piedmont Valley, and surprised and captured 15 of Mosby's guerrillas and furloughed soldiers, and a quantity of arms, equipments, and horses. The other column with myself passed into Manassas Gap to Markham, and furloughed soldiers, and a quantity of arms, equipments, horses, and some medical stores. The latter we destroyed. As we came near Paris about 40 guerrillas charged on my rear guard. I sent a squadron and charged, scattering them. No casualties on our side. I stopped one hour at Paris, and started to return at 1 o'clock. By this time the guerrillas had collected together in a body, numbering nearly 100 men, who made repeated attempts to capture my rear guard, which they paid dearly for. At one time 1 man was shot from his horse;l at another, 2 were knocked over, and norther, an officer, was dismounted and wounded, and was rescued by his comrades, but his horse and trappings fell into our hands.\n\nThe casualties on our side were: Captain Hart, First New Jersey, slightly wounded, and 2 horses killed. The guide you furnished me was of great assistance.\n\nVery respectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nJOHN W. KESTER,\n\nLieutenant-Colonel, Commanding."

One of the boats ran up Little River and destroyed the pontoon bridge. Captain John G. Randle, who was then at Trinity in command of the cavalry, did not even attempt to prevent it. I have the regret to report that I was very badly assisted by this officer, who, unfortunately, was the senior officer, and whom I had naturally placed in command. He did not notify me of the movement of the enemy, and it was only indirectly that I heard this morning that a gun-boat was aground, as I had the honor to inform you. This fact occurred in the following way: The gun-boat Numbers 13 was badly crippled by the fire of my artillery on the 2nd instant, and had to be towed down to Trinity. As she lay off Little River the current caught her, and in swinging to she ran aground. This took place about noon yesterday. The water had fallen considerably, and the two 32-pounders which had been rolled into the water at the mouth of Little River were partly visible above the surface, as I am informed by Captain Gillespie, who was in town with a cavalry picket. The enemy took them out and put them on board of one of the boats. During the night they dug up another of [the] guns which had been buried on the mound on which the fort was building, with the greater facility, as by burning the bridge they had interrupted communication between both banks of Little River. They also succeeded in pulling the damaged gun-boat from off the sand, and this morning at daybreak they left Trinity. My infantry consequently came too late to be of any service.\n\nIt is with feelings of deep regret that I have to report the loss of the guns, but as I am conscious to have done as much as I could under the circumstances, I would respectfully remind, through you, the brigadier-general commanding that these guns were withdrawn from my charge by superior order; that they were taken to Trinity without my advice, and that I was so circumstanced as to be without authority to oppose such removal. Furthermore, I would refer the general to my late correspondence with district headquarters, which will show that I had plainly foreseen and adverted to the danger of the situation. The enemy are said to have buried 15 dead on the bank of the Ouachita River. Such parts of the wooden boats as were not iron-plated were riddled with shot.\n\nI am, major, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nC. J. POLIGNAC,\n\nBrigadier-General, Commanding.\n\nMajor L. BUSH,\n\nAssistant Adjutant-General, & c.",

Army, commanding brigade.\n\nHEADQUARTERS POLIGNAC'S BRIGADE,\nHarrisonburg, La., March 3, 1864.\n\nMAJOR: I have the honor to report the following facts: On the 1st instant one iron-clad boat and five other boats (semi-gun-boats and semi-transports), part of which belong to the Mosquito Fleet, made their appearance off Beard's Point, on Black River, where my lower picket is located, and reached Trinity at 4.30 p. m. Having received intelligence of their approach, I notified Captain Devoe, of the engineer department, left at Trinity by Major Douglas, chief engineer, in time for him to secrete the 32-pounders that had been taken to Trinity by the direction of the latter officer, and which could not be used, as only one was mounted and there was no ammunition for them. Captain W. H. Gillespie, with 50 cavalry, engaged the enemy on the west bank of the Black River all the way up to Trinity, the enemy responding with a brisk artillery fire. The six boats stopped in front of Trinity and shelled the place and its neighborhood. I had disposed my infantry force along the north bank of Little River to protect as best I could the pontoon bridge, and also in order to detain the enemy, if possible, long enough for the captain of the Ruby (now engaged in getting lumber on Little River for the engineer corps) to be notified of their approach by a courier previously sent by me. The boats, however, did not come up Little River, and Lieutenant O. Gaudet, in command of the only section of artillery that I had, opened upon them with two 12-pounder howitzers, which, of course, were unable to check their progress. This officer behaved very well. His section was within 300 yards of the iron-clad boat, and stood the unequal contest with a great deal of coolness.\n\nAs soon as the gun-boats had run past Trinity, and thus made apparent their intention of attacking Harrisonburg, I moved my infantry and artillery back to that place that same night, as I had to ferry the Bushly Bayou, a navigable stream, where the enemy could easily head me off. It had rained on the day previous and the road had become almost impassable. Two caissons had to be left behind. I have since [had them] pulled out and brought to camp. I ordered the cavalry to remain at Trinity. Captain John G. Randle, by some unaccountable mistake, took his cavalry up Little River, so that the duty of guarding the town devolved upon Captain Gillespie alone.\n\nThis young officer behaved throughout with coolness, energy, and judgment, and I take great pleasure in commending him to the officers above me.\n\nOn the 2nd instant, at 10 a.m., the same boats hove in sight of Harrisonburg. I had placed two infantry regiments on the bank of the Ouachita River, from the mouth of the Bushly Bayou up to the vicinity of the town, and one section of artillery (6-pounder Parrott guns), under Captain Faries, at a place where it could do the most effective firing. The other section of the same battery could not participate in the fight for want of its caissons, and also because the horses were so badly used up by the night's march and the bad roads as to be altogether unfit for service. The enemy's boats were opened upon by our infantry and artillery at the same time. From the nature of their build the iron-clad was safe against my artillery, and the wooden boats were protected from the musketry by a plate of sheet-iron between two thicknesses of wood on their sides. Having ascertained that there were no guns on the front they moved slowly up, firing as they went as well on the troops on the bank of the river as at the town, in which several houses were riddled with shot, regardless of the lives of the women and children. One of the boats, apparently somewhat damaged by the fire of the artillery, dropped back below the mouth of the Bushly, and the balance went up the Ouachita. They returned about one hour afterward and threw some incendiary matter into a house in town immediately on the bank of the river, which caused that house and the neighboring ones to ignite instantly.\n\nFortunately I was able, with considerable exertion, to stop the conflagration, which had liked to have swept over the whole place. After this the boats ran down the river and lay all night 1 mile above Trinity. This morning they are shelling Trinity. I have not yet heard the particulars, and will forward as soon as possible another report. The enemy fired not less than 1,000 rounds, out of 24 and 32 pounders and 12-pounder Parrott guns and guns of smaller caliber, a great deal of grape, canister, and spherical case, and some 8 and 11 inch shells.\n\nThe troops, as a general rule, behaved well. Colonel Taylor and Lieutenant-Colonel Stone, in command of the infantry, led their regiments in a manner creditable to themselves. The fire from the boats was very heavy on the banks of the river. Both my aides (Captain S. Cuculler and Lieutenant W. Eggeling), whose coolness I feel my duty to report, lost their horses killed while they were in the discharge of their duty. The casualties are 3 killed and 13 wounded, 3 of which mortally.\n\nThe enemy had troops on board of their boats firing through loopholes. As they kept themselves constantly hid their number could not be ascertained. One of their boats was a very large one, which could carry 800 men, but it is believed that their force was not as large. The above is all I have to report. I regret that I did not achieve more, but, with the means at my disposal, to fight was about all that I could do.\n\nI am, major, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nC. J.

We halted here for dinner, and then resumed our march. About 8 miles farther on we saw 2 men mount and run. We pursued and shot both of them. They were dressed in Federal uniform. We marched on to Thomasville and camped for the night, having marched 23 miles. 13th.-Marched to James Harris', on Turkey Oak, and camped; marched 18 miles. 14th.-This day was spent in gathering together families to move north, and in scouting through the neighborhood. 15.-Marched to Eaton's, on Jack's Fork; distance, 20 miles. 16th.-We left a guard with the teams and came into Houston without making any further discoveries; distance, 22 miles. 17th.-Started in search of some rebels said to be on Possum Creek; found no signs, and camped at the house of Mr. Coats;marched 20 miles. 18th.-Marched down Possum to Joe Harris' place. Learned here that the guerrilla Bill Coats had been the night before at a house on Hamilton Creek. We learned that Coats had moved his camp to Big Piney. We went across to Piney, near James Johnson's place, and there scattered through the hills, hoping that some one of us might come upon the camp. We found nothing however, and all camped together at Smiley's Mill; marched 24 miles. 19th.-We scouted on Piney and Possum, but found nothing; camped at Jos. Gladdon's place; distance, 20 miles.",

I learned by one of my scouts that there was a squad of rebels in the Seneca Nation, and on marched 18 miles through the woods to avoid the rebels getting any information of my approach; halted until 2 a. m., 23rd; then moved to where I supposed I would find the enemy, and about an hour after sunrise I came upon 10 of them at a house. I had 6 men in the advance, which I had charge of. I made a charge on them, killing 2 of them and wounding several; the balance dispersed in the thick brush in Cowskin Bottom. One of the men we killed was a deserter from the Sixth Kansas Regiment, and was a lieutenant in Stand Watie's command. The other man was also one of Stand Watie's men, a half-breed. The deserter's name was Harden Talifaro.\n\nI think there are some 50 bushwhackers in the Seneca Nation, or in that vicinity. They do not stay all together, but are in small bands. I am going to make another scouting the nation before long, but I cannot take many men with me, for it would not be safe to do so. I am confident I can whip 50 of them with 25 of my men. It is a great place for guerrillas to hide in the Cowskin Bottom.\n\nSince my command has been reduced to one company I will have to be on the alert. I will have scouts out all the time southwest, which will enable me to learn of any approach of the enemy in force. In relation to forage, we are getting full rations of corn and about one-third rations of hay. I think I can obtain forage enough to subsist my company until we can work on the grass. I wish you to call the attention of commanding general to the large number of citizens that are absent from the border counties, and from what I can learn would come back if they had any encouragement to come. It would be great advantage to the State for the loyal families to come back and repair their farms and raise all the grain they can.\n\nThere are some fifty families of Newton and Jasper Counties who are now in Kansas, near Fort Scott, who would come back if the commanding general would give them some encouragement to come back to their homes.\n\nI am, with much respect, your most obedient servant,\n\nMILTON BURCH,\n\nCaptain Commanding Detach, Eighth Cavalry, Mo. State Militia.\n\nLieutenant W. D. HUBBARD,\n\nAct. Asst. Adjt. General, Dist. Southwest Mo.",

I did not meet with as good success as I had hoped to, but did finally succeed in driving them out of the Sni Hills, in which place I think there were about 200 of them. We found them in parties numbering from 10 to 40, but a running fight out of them, of which kind we had a good many. We took 2 horses from them, wounded 1. They have all gone east and northeast. I intend to bushwhack them when they return.\n\nC. F. COLEMAN,\n\nCaptain, Commanding.\n\nCaptain J. M. HADLEY,\n\nAct. Asst. Adjt. General, Dist of the Border",

COMPANY H, FIFTEENTH ILLINOIS CAVALRY,\nHelena, Ark., February 26, 1864.\n\nSIR: In accordance with instructions I received from you I marched from camp at 8 a. m. on the 21st of February to Simmas' farm; there encamped for the night. On the morning of the 22nd I crossed Big Creek after tedious time, being delayed by the boat having been destroyed previously. I then marched to Wallace's Ferry by the way of Trenton. In coming in sight of Trenton discovered some of the enemy; gave chase and had 1 man thrown from his horse and hurt severely, which caused another delay, which caused me to by behind time on arriving at the ferry. I found Captain Wier and the pickets I was so anxious [about] gone. I sent Lieutenant Campbell and 15 men upon the Thomas' Mill road.\n\nOn the 23rd instant Captain Wier came in front where he had been. I then sent 10 men and a sergeant to re-enforce Lieutenant Campbell, with orders, if there should be danger apprehended,to all fall back to the ferry. About 9.30 p. m. on the 23rd, I received orders from you for me to join you at Colonel Taylor's either that night or in the morning; also for me to turn over my prisoners with guard to Lieutenant Chase. About 11 o'clock that night heard firing in the direction where Lieutenant Campbell was posted. I immediately ordered the command mounted and marched to Thomas' Mill; crossing there, learned that the post had been surprised and most of the horses and arms captured. I lost from my company 1 men prisoners, with 1 lieutenant; had 1 private wounded, who is now in camp; also 1 enlisted man from Company L, prisoner, and 2 wounded. I lost, captured by the enemy, 11 Government horses and 6 private horses from my company, and 7 Government horses from detachment of Company L, with all the horse equipments and most of the arms.\n\nLearning that the enemy had left with so much the start that I could not reach them that night, owing to the difficulty of following the trail, I proceeded to Colonel Taylor's, arriving there at 3 a. m. the 24th instant, and reported to you.\n\nRespectfully submitted.\n\nEARA KING,\n\nCaptain, Commanding Detachment.\n\nMajor CARMICHAEL.",

Lieutenant Bold's report shows that he penetrated several miles into Arkansas, and was at one time within about 3 miles of Colonel Freeman's camp, though at the time not aware of his proximity. From information gained, the lieutenantsays Freeman's whole force may be estimated at from 400 to 500 men, and that they are very poorly armed and supplies with ammunition. The scout was frequently fired on from the brush while below Thomasville. The lieutenant returned the fire a number of times and in this way killed 7 of the guerrillas, including Colonel Freeman's quartermaster, Lieutenant Lamb. He also captured and brought in 3 prisoners, 8 horses, 2 mules, and a few worthless guns.\n\nI would respectfully suggest that if a scout of about three companies was sent down to Spring River and allowed to remain there for a fortnight, they could effectual break up this band of thieves. Lieutenant Bold reports that there is plenty of forage for a force of 300 for the period mentioned, and that subsistence can easily be obtained for that number of men.\n\nI have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nRICHARD MURPHY,\n\nCaptain, Commanding.\n\nCaptain J. LOVELL,\n\nAsst. Adjt. General, Rolla, Mo.",

Pushed forward and halted at crossing of Hookram and Batesville and Batesville and Salem Raod to await junction of forces under command of Captains Majors and Potts. Command formed junction at 8.30 a. m. At 10 a.m. started on Salem road, having sent two squadron for forage. After traveling one-fourth of a mile, crossed road running east and west and passed plantation of Mr. Jacks; no fodder, but little corn, and no cattle fit for use. One-half mile father, same road, passed Hycomb's house; no forage or cattle. One-half mile farther passed Bronw's and changed direction to northwest, taking road to Ash Falt, crossing at intervals of 1 mile each eight roads leading to the northeast. Pursed this route for 8 miles and crossed a small stream at Couch's house. No forage or cattle. One-fourth mile farther we came to Simpson's plantation, where we halted (it being noon), fed, and left the men get their diners. Sent out parties in different directions to search for information of the enemy. One of the parties returned, bringing as a prisoner Captain Adams, a noted character. No definite information was obtained. Left Simpson's at 4.50 p. m., and started for Widow Davidson's, on the Yellville and Jackson road, distant 6 miles; arriving there are we found that she had 30 bushels of corn, and we then took a northeasterly course for Phillips'. Whilst en route to Phillips' we captured a Mr. Smiley; he was riding a mule and had a McClellan saddle and bridle; he stated that he was going to Luneneburg to attend to some business before a Masonic lodge. Took him with us as a prisoner. Arrived at Phillips' at 7 p. m. and camped; plenty of forage for the animals. Rained during the night.",

FORCES,\nBrasher City, La., February 6, 1864.\n\nSIR: I would respectfully submit to the colonel commanding the district the following report of the expedition commanded by me, consisting of 75 infantry and one section of artillery, on the steamers J. M. Brown and Red Chief, which left here the evening of the 3rd instant:\n\nWe proceeded up Grand Lake in to Lac Fausses Pointe, at the extreme northern point of which we landed, at Dauteriove's plantation.\n\nSaw some pickets of the enemy, who ran away as we approached. Found a good landing with 4 feet of water, and a good road to Saint Martinsville. Discovered traces of a camp that had been occupied lately by a force, perhaps 1,500 strong. There was a small work running across the road about 1,200 paces from the landing, with an abatis in front of it. Everything was deserted. Did not see anything of the force said to be on the lake. From there went up Bayou L'Embarras, but saw nothing. Obtained some 3 mules and 3 horses; one was marked \"U. S.\" Have turned them over to the quartermaster. Returned through Lac Fausse Pointe and proceeded up Grand Lake through Lake Chicot, Bayou Chene, Lake Marringoula and Bauou Tensas, into Grand River, and landed at Offutt's saw-mill, where we took on some lumber. Sent 2 men in a skiff down Grand River, who returned and reported that they saw some men running down on the banks of the bayou.\n\nWent down with the steamer Red Chief and came to a small bayou, up which I sent Captain Evans with a small party. The mente were after to the woods, excepting one, who remained with a flat-boat. He was taken in tow and brought to the steamer. He had on board his flat 5 or 6 bales of dry-goods, a box of sundries, a lot curry-combs, 4 or 5 sacks of coffee, 1 bale of rope, flour, potatoes, 3 bottles of quinine, with other parcels of medicine, &c.,and $30,000 in Confederate money, all of which I turned over to the provost-marshal. He had no papers authorizing him to take the goods outside of the lines, but said the officers at Plaquuemine knew of it. He gave his names Thorn. I also overhauled 2 Jews, who produced passes from provost-marshal to go outside the lines, and whom I then let go. I also took on Grand River, near Offutt's mill, 12 1\\2 hogsheads of sugar. A man there claimed it and also claimed to be a Union man, and whom I brought down with me. The sugar I turned over to the post commissary. By all I can learn there is quite and extensive trade carried on between Plaquemine and Butte a a la Rose. I also took a Confederate soldier, who claimed to be a deserter; but doubting his story, brought him with me and delivered him to the provost-marshal. From Grand River we returned by way of Whisky By and Bay and Bayou La Rampe and Grand Lake, picking up on the way 2 men, who were running the lines.\n\nAll of which is respectfully submitted.\n\nVery respectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nNICHOLAS W. DAY,\n\nColonel, Commanding Post.\n\nCaptain WILLIAM J. DENSLOW,\n\nActing Assistant Adjutant-General.",

FORCES IN TEXAS,\nMatagorda Bay, February 23, 1864.\n\nSIR: Brigadier-General Warren, commanding at Indianola, reports that 25 mounted infantrymen, who were scouting and driving cattle 8 miles from his post yesterday, were surrounded and charged upon by well-armed and well-mounted cavalry of the enemy, 55 strong. The horses of our men were poor scrubs and not trained to fire, and when the men fired a volley at the distance of 50 yards, 14 of them were unhorsed. The enemy immediately closed on them with revolvers, and the 14 were captured, the other 11 escaping. General Warren reports that the affair reflects no credit on the officer in command, and I have notified him that I expect an investigation.\n\nVery respectfully,\n\nN. J. T. DANA,\n\nMajor-General.\n\nCaptain A. B. SHARPE,\n\nAct. Asst. Adjt. General, 13th Corps, New Orleans.",

Were you a fugitive from fear, or did you flee as a man who wants to be an enemy? Had you come to me frankly you would have found a friend. The Government has not believed that you really desired to fight it, but your conduct leaves the matter in great doubt and will expose your people. Why did you send for soldiers to keep the troops of the United States out of the Chickasaw Nation? Your treaties require you to admit their presence. Are we to understand that you now want formally to break these treaties? These questions must be answered, and answered soon. Your power as head man was not given you to gratify your prejudice or pride. You are responsible to your people, and have no right to expose them to ruin when the Government offers them mercy.\n\nThe President has issued a proclamation in which he offers pardon and peace to those who, even in this moment of its destruction, abandoned this wicked and unnecessary war. You cannot fail to see the end coming. Are you justified in shutting the eyes of your people to it? The offer Government of the United States will soon crush all the enemies. Let me know if you want to be among them.\n\nI send you some letters by a prisoners to head men of some Indiana nations; deliver them; they have a right to know what the United States Government says. Their blood may be upon you if you neglect it. I shall hold you accountable for their safe delivery.\n\nI remain, with respect, yours, &c.,\n\nWM. A. PHILLIPS,\n\nColonel, Commanding U. S.

He says on this side of the river, aside from pickets and couriers, there are a few hundred of the enemy near Morganza, about 4,000 at Alexandria, and quite a large army at Shreveport, waiting for the water to rise in the Red River to connect with their fleet at that point. Everything quiet about here. Nothing of importance occurred here.\"\n\nVery respectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nEDWARD L. MOLINEUX\n\nColonel, Commanding."

Rained all forenoon; snowed till night.\n\nThe land for several miles is very good, the best tract of land I have seen in the State; good farms, good timber and soil; well adapted to the growth of corn and cotton.

          "text": "HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF KANSAS,\nJanuary 27, 1864.\n\nMajor General H. W. HALLECK,\n\nGeneral-in-Chief:\n\nYour telegraph concerning the discharge of prisoners was duly received, and the impropriety will be properly investigated when your papers arrive. It had transpired previous to my assuming command. I shall see that deserters to through with their commands. I have written the honorable Secretary of War concerning arms for this department's depots, and I hope you will use your influence in this regard. The depots on the Upper Arkansas and this post should be protected with field-works, that can be erected with little expense to the Government. Such works at Rolla, Springfield, Cape Girardeau, prevented losses, as I think, infinitely greater than the cost of the field-works and the guns inside; besides, I have but few troops and must therefore use embankments and siege guns to help guard stores.\n\nI also wrote for light pieces of artillery, which on prairies and in mountains I have found so very useful as to be everywhere desired in this region of country. Great excitement is growing up in regard to new gold mines, and new routes to the mines will probably end some protection. A few cavalry with mounted howitzers will be the best force for escorts, and I have therefore asked for a large supply, but no more than necessary for guarding boats, arming cavalry, and guarding overland routes economically. I have also asked for cavalry and infantry arms. There are two regiments of cavalry here, one full and the other nearly so, without carbines or revolvers; I want to put them in the field. The old regiments are never more than half armed, and I earnestly desire to have all my cavalry armed with the new be repeating fire-arms, so they can be of the utmost strength.\n\nThe Kansas cavalry can be made very effective. They are good horsemen and brave.\n\nI have also asked for infantry arms. We have new and substantial store-houses for ordinance, and arsenal building erected that will soon be supplied with machinery. I think it would be well to have, say, 10,000 good muskets for accidental demand, and to be carefully repaired and ready for the occasion. To prevent misunderstandings and secure the utmost celerity of moves against rebel raids, I have urged some express understanding as to troops that must be stationed at Van Buren and Fort Smith, and how they are to be amply supplied during the high water in the Arkansas River. Fort Smith is on the wrong side of the river, on ground ill suited to defensive works. Van Buren, 4 miles below, is on this side, and the heights adjacent command the lower country and river, and could be better fortified.\n\nIf we make a great depot on the Fort Smith side it would invite assault, but if any stores are on the north side of the Arkansas a river and a mountain are part of our defenses. Besides, stores and forces on the other side of the Arkansas can be cut off from forces on this side, by burning or crippling of a ferry-boat, an accident or design that may be apprehended. As the vicinity of Fort Smith crossing connects with the road and mountain passes which seem to be the doorway and avenue for rebel movements into Missouri, Kansas, and the Indian Territory, I consider it important that should be well located, fortified, and garrisoned with a force sufficient to take any rebel force in flank or rear that small dare to cross the Arkansas River either 50 [miles] above or below.\n\nWe have now got the armed rebels mainly below the Arkansas. Our gun-boats can operate on the river in high water, and it becomes the proper base for forces of this department. Some troubles are apprehended with guerrillas organizations on the Missouri border, and some force is therefore necessary to quiet matters there; but generally matters seem quiet, and I shall do all in my power to keep them so. Hoping to receive your co-operation and directions in the premises.\n\nI have the honor to be, general, your obedient servant,\n\nS. R. CURTIS,\n\nMajor-General."

I take you with me to clean out the Indian Nation south of the river and drive away and destroy the rebels. Let me say a few words to you that you are not to forget. Do not begin firing in battle until you are ordered. When you fire, aim low, about the knee, or at the lower part of a man's body, if on horseback. Never fire in the air. Fire slowly and never until you see something to shoot at that you may hit. Do not waste your ammunition. Do not straggle or go away from the command; it is cowards only that leave their comrades in the face of the enemy; nearly all the men we get killed are stragglers. Keep with me close and obey orders, and we will soon have peace. Those who are still in arms are rebels, who ought to die. Do not kill a prisoner after he has surrendered. But I do not ask you to take prisoners. I ask you to make your footsteps severe and terrible.\n\nMuscogees! the time has now come when you are to remember the authors of all your sufferings; those who started a needless and wicked war, who drove you from your homes, who robbed you of your property. Stand by me faithfully and we will soon have peace. Watch over each other to keep each other right, and be ready to strike a terrible blow on those who murdered your wives and little ones by the Red Fork along the Verdigris or by Dave Farm Cowpens. Do not be afraid. We have always beaten them. We will surely win. May God go with us.\n\nWM. A. PHILLIPS,\n\nColonel, Commanding."

I find a large number of boats on the lakes which assist the inhabitants to carry on smuggling, and could, if collected, convey a force of 300 or 400 men to within a short march of our lines on La Fourche. I deem it advisable to destroy these, leaving a sufficient number of the smaller ones for fishing purposes. The inhabitants assist the Confederates in coming over in small squads, notwithstanding pickets and scouts. I am satisfied from personal observations this would not only be just and proper,but would aid in preventing raids. If the telegraph is run up to Donaldsonsville along the bayou, it may be frequently cut, unless I hold the inhabitants responsible by ordering them to report any one tampering with it. Shall I act thus in regard to the boats and wire?\n\nE. L. MOLINEUX,\n\nColonel, Commanding."

ORD,\n\nCommanding Thirteenth Army Corps, New Orleans:\n\nGENERAL: There is a Mr. Veazie, who belongs perhaps to Armstrong's scouts and who is at present at Franklin's camp, who ought to be here. I am informed that he is not a useful man in Louisiana, but would be very useful here. Will you be good enough to procure and forward him to me? The rebels are reported 1,200 strong at Sabine Pass; they are also erecting a large fort on Bolivar Point, opposite Galveston; they have also brought down the guns from Sachem and Clifton, say four 9-inch, five 32 and two 30-pounder Parrotts, and have them in position at Houston and south of there.\n\nI have just started Brigadier-General Ransom up the peninsula on a reconnaissance in force, to the head of it, about 50 miles. He has with him a brigade of infantry, one piece of artillery, and 50 mounted men, and I shall place the Thirteenth Maine on board two gun-boats this afternoon and land them, if weather permits, about 25 miles above where Ransom will be to-morrow morning at daylight. I hope to capture some scouts and vedettes, perhaps to whip a cavalry force, at all events I wish to keep up a spirit of enterprise and have the troops inured to campaigning, and teach the enemy that we are active in every direction. Please forward us forage in considerable quantities.\n\nI have the honor to remain, very respectfully,\n\nN. J. T. DANA,\n\nMajor-General, Commanding."

The citizen who gave the information saw the prisoners and recognized them, they being at the time in the hands of 4 rebel cavalry-men (armed), who stated that they would \"be down in a few days and take the rest of them.\" I sent out a file of mounted men and 1 officer, armed with revolvers, to gain as much information as possible.\n\nOn their return the officer reported having been told by one Mr. Rentrop, a citizen, that one of his negroes saw a party of about 15 mounted men pass through his plantation between 10 and 11 o'clock last night, leading several horses and having several dismounted men with them. I have since learned that the 3 missing men borrowed horses from plantations in this vicinity and were seen within 1 mile of the place where the railroad was torn up, about 9 p.m. 19th instant. Four trains have passed this station during the past twenty-four hours, three of them having troops on board en route for Algiers, the other being a special with Assistant Superintendent Green.\n\nI have the honor to be, sir, most respectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nN. SHAURMAN,\n\nLieutenant-Colonel, Commanding Ninetieth Regiment New York Vols."

He informed me that a communication from Washington had been received by him relative to a concentration of forces on the line of the Red River, a copy of which will be transmitted to you without delay.\n\nMajor-General Sherman starts to-morrow or next day on an expedition, to consist of about 20,000 men, against General Polk, now commanding an army at or near Jackson, Miss. This he said would occupy his attention some twenty or twenty-five days, at the expiration of which time he hoped that the water in the Red and Atchafalaya Rivers would be sufficiently high to admit of navigation, when he would heartily co-operate with you in the movement suggested in your dispatch.\n\nMajor-General Steele is at Little rock, whither I will proceed by the shortest possible route, which his to the mouth of the Arkansas River, then to Devall's Bluff, and so by rail to Little Rock. I may probably be detained a day or two by being forced to wait for a boat bound up the Arkansas. The river is rising very fast, which will enable us to take the Northerner as far up as Memphis, for which city we leave Vicksburg at 4 a. m. to-morrow.\n\nI have the honor to be, general, your most obedient servant,\n\nROBERT T.

General Ewing will turn over the command to me as soon as I can relieve the Kansas troops. I have ordered Colonel Dodd to send two squadrons directs from Sedalia to Bates County, two to Harrisonville, one to Pleasant Hill. I shall post two squadrons at Independence, one at Hickaman Mills, one at Westport, and three at this post. I find that I am going to be very scarce of transportation, as General Ewing will probably take most of his transportation as infantry, and would respectfully ask that horses may be obtained for them as soon as possible. It is necessary that they all be mounted and drilling. I shall take a complete tour through my sub-district as soon as I take command.\n\nVery respectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nJAS. H. FORD,\n\n2nd Colo. Vol. Cav., Commanding 4th Sub-Dist., Central Dist. of Mo."

          "text": "HEADQUARTERS U. S. FORCES IN TEXAS,\nMatagorda Peninsula, January 18, 1864\n\nMajor General E. O. C. ORD,\n\nCommanding Thirteenth Army Corps, New Orleans:\n\nI wrote you a hurried unofficial note by Major Seward yesterday, and since then nothing of interest has transpired here.\n\nThis is the sixth day since my arrival here, and my time has been mostly occupied in reconnoitering. I spent one day at Indianola, where all of the First Division now in Texas in concentrated, and where I have to-day ordered the Sixteenth Ohio Battery and one 30-pounder of Battery L, [First] Indiana. I have taken the brigade from Matagorda Island, and now have all the white troops at this pass now stationed on the peninsula under command of Ransom, Fort Esperanza is garrisoned by the Fourteenth Rhode Island Heavy Artillery and seven companies of the Second Engineers, Corps d'Afrique, under command of Colonel Cobb. The forces at Indianola are under the immediate command of General Benton. I shall begin to fortify that place to a small extent.\n\nI presume you have had access to my reports made heretofore to the major-general commanding the department, and are informed as to my views as to the disposition of the forces now on the Rio Grande;l they are of no effect now, but if needed on that frontier should be mostly posted near the Nueces River. If the cavalry force now there, which has been nursed and organized with much trouble and great cost of time, sent on a cotton hunt to Eagle Pass or that vicinity they will get cotton, but will make themselves unserviceable so far as the necessary and effective co-operation with this force is concerned.\n\nAll the cavalry there an the batteries of artillery and half the infantry should march across the country to co-operate with this column, forming a junction near Victoria. All the infantry which does not march across should land at Corpus Christi or Copana and unite with the column again near San Patricio or Refugio. A movement of this force would at the same time meet that movement and support it either by its operations on the east or west of Lavaca Bay toward Texana, Hallettsville, or Victoria. A discreet officer, either General Herron or some other general officer, who, by his management, would prevent misunderstandings with our neighbors and would resist and discountenance corruption and speculation, should be put in command on the Rio Grande, with a garrison of 500 men at Brownsville and 200 at Brazos Island.\n\nAs for the trade with Eagle Pass and Lavaca,the defeat of Magruder involves the entire regulation of all those matters, as well as the complete revolution of Texas. We must meet him in the open field and beat him, otherwise we are wasting our time and forces to little effect, in occupying a few scattered points, the possession of which are not contested. We can beat him by concentrating a superior force and not allowing him time for more preparations. If we defeat him in the first general action Texas is revolutionized, and a large portion of its men will join us and his army will dissolve. If we risk a campaign against him with an inferior force, we may beat him, but if he should defeat us, or even hold his own in the first general engagement then we might justly expect to engage in a long campaign before we regained our present influence over the wavering portion of the population, whose confidence would be greatly shaken. I do not speak of a march up this peninsula for I have no idea it will at the present time be entertained. I have been to the mouths of the Caney, San Bernard, and Brazos, where I occupied a day in reconnoitering and shelling and at each of which places the enemy has erected strong works which cover considerable ground. He is evidently in force in that neighborhood and has several steam-boats, three of which I saw carrying supplies on his inland waters. Some of these boats are \"cotton-clad,\" and one, the Carr, was lately supposed to have been destroyed. I have reason to suppose this is not so, or to believe the Carr still in order.\n\nThe mouth of the Caney is four marches from here and the mouth of the Brazos is five. Had the force of 4,000 men which first arrived here immediately pressed forward, it is most likely the first on the mouth of the Brazos would have been in our possession at the end of six days, and the blow would have been a mortal one to the rebel cause; but to attempt that march now would be under very different circumstances. The whole force we have here now is not an equivalent for that which we then had, as estimated merely against numbers; and, in addition to this the march would be contested and resisted at several points by fortifications across a narrow defile, where the enemy has expended a great deal of labor and skill in successive lines of defense to stop a line approach, which, according to the information he has had, and judging from the demonstrations which have been he is convinced we had decided you. Magruder has a large cavalry force, and we have none; for want of it we cannot obtain information nor scout actively, and are unable to pursue and punish any of his prowlers or marauding parties. To commence active operations effectively we ought to have 3,000 good cavalry. We have little or no transportation and require 200 wagons and 50 ambulances. We are well supplied with subsistence at present, having on hand about thirty days'. We need much clothing, estimates of which have been sent, but we ought not to be hindered by another greatcoat, as we have now by some blunder about 3,000, and we have camp-kettles and mess-pans enough for a large army.\n\nAmmunition should be immediately forwarded. I have approved an estimate of the ordnance officer to-day. I hope you will see it attended to; if not, I have not much faith in receiving it. We are very badly in want of wood for fuel, and a very great deal of suffering exists because of it; we are obliged to go 10 miles to pick up soggy and rotten driftwood on the beach, and the work is attended with great danger of capture. Every light vessel which comes down should bring a few cords of wood, proportioned to her size, the large steamers bringing 20 or 30 cords and the schooners 5 or 6, for the quartermaster's department for issue to the troops. I am not sure that it would be judicious to obtain our supplies direct from New York, if a class of vessels can be obtained which are light enough to come over this bar loaded andd are fast. I believe the change would be beneficial. We want boats here badly, and I have directed Captain Constable to call for twelve, four of which shall be life-boats. We require about 125 artillery horses for the batteries here.\n\nI understand my orders now to be, according to verbal communications from Major-General Washburn and dispatches addressed to him by the commanding general, which were received by me by the Alabama, and from the tenor of your letters of the 12th instant, not to attempt offensive operations, but to strengthen and fortify myself here and at Indianola, awaiting an increase of force and cavalry. Expeditions may be made for short marches into the interior, without much risk, but they are not attended with beneficial results. I doubt the policy of occupying a place, inducing our friends to expose themselves to certain punishment by espousing our cause openly, and then by a hurried abandonment for the purpose of securing our communication from interruption leaving them to the mercy of the assassins who have never been known to show mercy. I could, as I believe, march to Victoria any day, and occupy it, but the line from Indianola there is 40 miles, and from Lavaca there 26 miles, and without a heavy cavalry force it would keep my whole force actively engaged to keep that line secure in the face of such a force as Magruder has before us.\n\nI take it for granted the remainder of the Third Division is on the way. There are still four regiments of the First Division in Louisiana, and two of the Fourth Division. When the whole corps and all its artillery is in Texas, and all the efficient men detained in the convalescent camp and about New Orleans are with it a portion of this column with that marching from the Rio Grande would with the aid of the cavalry above mentioned, make us strong enough to assume the offensive vigorously, with a fair prospect of beating Magruder in a hard-contested battle. I shall be very glad to receive you here, and will at all times be in readiness to aid you with all my powers, and to give effect to your orders with whatever ability I possess. I trust your health may now be such as to admit of your bearing the exposure of a campaign without subjecting you to the suffering you have lately experienced. I hope you will not think I have detained any member of your staff here, regardless of your wants and wishes; those I keep are such as I suppose, after consultation with Colonel Scates, Major Seward, and Major Ord, you would not care to have in New Orleans, and I am so poorly off in material here that they are indispensable to my operations here at present. You have only to notify me, when I shall send any and all you want, by the same steamer. I retain also a desk and printing press, in the conviction that you can replace them in a moment in New Orleans, and I cannot get them here at all.\n\nI remain, with much respect and esteem,\n\nN. J. T. DANA,\n\nMajor-General."

A regiment of New York veteran cavalry is now being embarked at this place. It is sent with equipments but without horses, as transportation for horse by sea cannot now be procured. The Quartermaster-General expects to send you horses by the Mississippi River. A regiment of infantry will be ready here as soon as vessels can be obtained. The two regiments in Maine, reported ready for the field and ordered to you, are now reported not quite ready.\n\nSeveral regiments of Indiana troops are expected to be ready in a short time. They will be sent by the Mississippi River. Some of the New York regiments are also reported as nearly ready. There may, however, be some delay in getting them off for want of ocean vessels. The difficulty results in part from the detention of seagoing vessels in the Department of the Gulf. To obviate it, such vessels should be returned North as early as possible. Unless this is done, there must be deadly in sending you troops from the North and East.\n\nVery respectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nH. W. HALLECK,\n\nGeneral-in-Chief."

A considerable portion of the Thirteenth Corps has also re-enlisted, and all would have been obtained, except for the orders received from the War Department in regard to the suspension of bounties. We have since received information that the bounties are renewed, and I am quite confident that a greater part, if not all, of these two corps will re-enlist. The spirit of the troops is admirable. The will considerably reduce my command, but a sufficient force will be left for the operations referred to in the accompanying dispatch,*\n\nwhich we shall commence as soon as the navigation permits.\n\nI cannot but express my great gratification at the report which you make of re-enforcements for this department, which I hope may be sufficient to compensate for the loss by furloughs. I have received a communication from General Sherman in regard to the stoppage of our forage on the river, and hope that all difficulties in this respect will be removed. The political indications in this State are satisfactory. I entertain no doubt that a full vote will be given in the election of the 22nd of February, and that the State officers, with a full delegation in both Houses of Congress, composed of earnest and intelligent supporters of the Administration and disposed to co-operate with the military forces of the department, will be ready for service by the middle of April.\n\nThere is great unanimity of feeling with the people in this State as to election. No serious objection is made except on the part of persons whose private plans have been somewhat disturbed by the immediate organization of a State government. Let me assure you that attention to questions relating to the Government will not interfere with a preparation for military movements.\n\nI have the honor to be, with much respect your obedient servant,\n\nN.

This force can hold this position against any equal force of the enemy. To hold the position against any force which the enemy might bring will require about 4,000 infantry and two field batteries. I think that in any event the cavalry force here should be increased to 2,000 effective, and that at least one gun-boat of very light draught should be at Franklin.\n\nIf it will be impossible to increase the cavalry and furnish the gun-boat, then I recommend that if this place be threatened by the enemy in large force the command be withdrawn so far that the gun-boats now in Berwick Bay can aid it. Any point below Bisland will fulfill this condition, but I recommend that this place be held, and that the force be increased by the cavalry and gun-boat already specified. I have seen no indication of an immediate attack by the enemy, but I think his movement will be governed by ours. Our troops here are in.\n\nI should mention that more than 1,000 of the men ar entitled to furloughs as veterans, as also in one field battery of four guns. These losses should be made good here as soon as they take place. There is on colored regiment here that I have not counted.\n\nW. B. FRANKLIN,\n\nMajor-General, Commanding."

SHERMAN,\n\nCommanding Fifteenth Army Corps:\n\nGENERAL: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your dispatch of the 16th instant.* I have taken measures to give the impression of a movement against Mobile, and directed maneuvering of boats in the vicinity of Pascagoula in such a manner as to confirm this impression. The success of the movement indicated by you will be very important to our cause. I only regret that we had not been able to occupy Mobile at the close of the campaign against Vicksburg and Port Hudson. The course you have suggested in regard to the stoppage of our forage boats will be satisfactory. I do not doubt that with a knowledge of all the circumstances, all cause of complaint will be removed. The tone of the letter of the chief quartermaster is not such as I could wish or approve; but great embarrassments are occasioned to us by this interference with our boats, and has sometimes caused bad feeling.\n\nSince receiving your dispatch General Halleck informs me that it is possible the forces on the west bank of the river in Arkansas and Louisiana, with re-enforcements from your command, may be concentrated on the Red River for the defense of Arkansas and Louisiana and offensive operations against Texas. With the forces indicated such a movement will be successful, and confer important advantages on the Government. The occupation of Shreveport will be as fatal to the troops west of the Mississippi as that of Chattanooga to the east. I earnestly hope that this co-operation may be effected. My own force is not sufficient to enable me to go to the Red River with safety, and if left to myself, I can only operate feebly, with my present command, from the coast, which would perhaps give us the control of Western Texas, but weaken us to the same extent in Louisiana, and leaving the mass of the enemy in our center. I was very glad to receive your assurances that such a movement would be acceptable to you, and hope that speedy measures may be taken to carry it into effect. I can occupy Alexandria as soon as the water in the Atchafalaya and Red Rives rises so as to enable us to use water communication.\n\nIt will give me pleasure to know if you have received communications from the Department of War upon this subject, and to what extent you will be able to assist us if the plan shall be adopted. Captain Robert T. Dunham, of my staff, will present this to you. He is an officer who can be relied upon, and I beg you will communicate to him any information that may be of service. He also bears dispatches to Major-General Steele, commanding forces in Arkansas, and will communicate to you any information he may receive from him upon this general subject. I shall lose no opportunity to give you early information of occurrences in this department as they may transpire, or of the orders I may receive from the Government at Washington.\n\nI have the honor to be, with much respect, you obedient servant,\n\nN. P. BANKS,\n\nMajor-General, Commanding."

STONE, Chief of Staff:\n\nGENERAL: After three weeks' trial, I am satisfied that our line of communication via Point Isabel is not the correct one under existing circumstances. The steamers carrying supplies to this post are of such a draught that they cannot get nearer than 5 miles to Point Isabel, where they anchor and transfer the charge to river boats to be carried to the point.\n\nThese smaller boats approach to within 50 feet of shore, a wharf having been constructed that length. From here goods are carried by wagons to Brownsville, it requiring two days to make the trip each way, and water being found at only one point on the route. Water is also carried back by these teams for men as well as animals at Point Isabel.\n\nWhat I propose to do is to build a wharf at Brazos Island and establish the depots there, bridge Boca Chica, and transport all supplies by wagons along the beach to the mouth of the Rio Grande, and shipping there on rive boats for Brownsville. If is 9 miles from the wharf at Brazos Island to the mouth of the river, the road along the beach hard an in fine condition. For a few days each month this road might be impassable, but I propose to construct another road inside of the sand hills that will be protected in all water. By this route we shall have but 9 miles of land transportation and can unload much more rapidly than by the present way. The garrison at Point Isabel, will, of course, be contained, but a portion of the Sixteenth Corps d'Afrique will be moved to the mouth of the river as a guard, and to handle stores. I inclose a sketch that will give you an idea of the new route.\n\nVery respectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nF. J. HERRON,\n\nMajor-General, Commanding.\n\nThe sketch was not ready; will send it by next mail."

Captain Ritchey's company and one other were ordered from Newtonian to Keatsville two days ago. Detain these two companies at Cassville until further orders. If they have arrived at Keatsville or are on the way there, order them to Cassville. How many men has Captain Duff at Berryville? If he is not strong enough to hold his position, let him fall back slowly. How are the fords? If things continue to look the same, I think I will come to Cassville to-night. Answer. The forces arriving at Cassville should be sent forward to Berryville as soon as possible, or in that direction.\n\nJOHN B. SANBORN,\n\nBrigadier-General, Commanding."

I scouted on the Missouri River two days and found no sign of bushwhackers or boats. We looked at every foot of the river bank from the month of Little Blue to La Fayette line. We then went south on the west line of this district to Grand River, then up both sides of the Grand to Dayton, where we struck the trail of some Company L men, who were stationed at Dayton. We leave this day at noon for Grand River, taking a southwest course through Grand and its branches. Our horses are getting pretty thin, and will need some time to recruit when we get in. I hear of 2 men that were sent up to you. I hope you will keep them for us to escort to Warrensburg or somewhere else. I am happy to inform you that we have not come onto a bushwhacker trail since we started, nor heard of one, and we have scoured the country where we went well. Have followed up many trails, but they come out all right when followed up.\n\nTrusting the above will meet with your approbation, I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nB. F. ALLEN,\n\nCommanding Scouts."

Several skirmishes have taken place since you left, the country being full of guerrillas. Fitzwilliams, with his band of accomplished cut-throats, has been in close proximity with this place for a number of days past. He attacked our train several times between here and Rosewille, but could not effect anything. The organization of the militia will render available service and co-operate very advantageously with the present military forces in this district at present. I inclose you copy of General Orders, Numbers 4. We are pleased to learn that our worthy Governor indorsed its organization. Do what you can for me, judge.

Carleton, commanding the Department of New Mexico, dated Santa Fe, N. Mex., March 7, 1864. In this letter General Carleton desired you to transfer to the Department of New Mexico a certain amount of public transportation and subsistence stores; he also stated that I would explain to you the reasons which compelled him to make this request. Shortly before I left Santa Fe for California, General Carleton received orders from the Headquarters of the Army to concentrate at some convenient point within his department, all of the cavalry at this command, with a view of organizing a column to operate against the rebels in Texas. This column was to move as soon as practicable down the valley of the Rio Grande as far as Eagle Pass, at which point it was to be joined by a force to be sent up from the coast by Major-General Banks. The Commander-in-Chief did not make known the ultimate destination of this force, but directed that his orders referred to above be carried into effect with a little delay as possible. General Carleton at present has at his disposal but a limited amount of public transportation, and it is next to impossible to purchase mules or wagons in New Mexico at this time; he desired me to say that if you could furnish the transportation and supplies asked for he would be able to act efficiently, otherwise it would be extremely difficult for him to carry out in a satisfactory manner the orders received from the War Department.\n\nI have the honor to be, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nBEN. C. CUTLER,\n\nAssistant Adjutant-General, U. S. Volunteers."

McCLERNAND,\n\nCommanding Thirteenth Corps:\n\nGENERAL: I can hardly express the regear I felt at being unable to see you while here and confer with you in regard to matters of importance connected with thais command. In visiting the different portions of the town with the surgeon-in-chief, to make arrangements for small-pox patients and to prevent the spread of that disease among our soldiers and the citizens, I undertunately caught the disease myself, and was confined almost three weeks to bed with the variouloid. At present I am feeling quite well, although not as strong as I could wish. Your letter of the 7th instant was haded me, and I thank you for the complimentary manner in which my troops and the various departments are spoken of.\n\nThe regiments composing my division have all been with me for the past two years, and are among the best troops in the service. I have seen them tried and can assure you they will bring no discredit upon the corps. It is the first time they have received encouragement (except from myself) since in this department. Your kind words were fully appreciated. In regard to the fortification s, our relations with the authorities on the others side, and many other matters of importance, I will say nothing until I see you personally, which I shall endeavor to do within the next two weeks. There is nothing late from the interior of Texas or Mexico. A general rumor prevails that Colonel Ford will attack this place, but I consider it an impossibility. Brigadier-General Benton has arrived and been assigned to duty. Let me assure you, general, that although as a division we have not before served under you, yet we hail your return to the command of the corps with as much pleasure and delight as any of your old troops.\n\nWith great respect, your obedient servant,\n\nF. J. HERRON,\n\nMajor-General."

You had not when the letter was written received my instructions of the 31st of March. I hope those instructions reached you before such a movement was commenced. I would much rather the Red River expedition had never been begun than that you should be detained one day after the 1st of May in commencing your movement east of the Mississippi.\n\nIf you have commenced to move from Shreveport to the interior of Texas, or away from the Red River in any direction, retrace your steps on receipt of this. No matter what you may have in contemplation, commence your concentration, to be followed without deadly by your advance on Mobile. Hopin that General Hunter will find you back at New Orleans, with the work of concentration commenced,\n\nI remain, &c.,\n\nU. S. GRANT,\n\nLieutenant-General."

Company G has traveled a distance of 150 miles, or about 1 1/2 miles each, on escort duty. Company H has traveled a distance of 160 miles, or about 1 1/2 miles each, on escort duty. The troops at Mound Prairie Church have done some scouting in that vicinity, but can find no trace of bushwhackers. The troops at Republican Church killed a man by the name of Fear, said to belong to Gann's band of bushwhackers. With this exception they have found nothing of any further trace of bushwhackers.\n\nI am, very respectfully, colonel, your obedient servant,\n\nALEX. W.

The rebels wish to stop and prevent planting in West Kentucky and Tennessee. The intention of the rebels in Northern Arkansas, and of the guerrillas, with a powerful armed secret organization here, is to do the same in Missouri, and the time of the advent of their operations is at hand, for which reason no move of troops from the interior to increase the feelings of insecurity here should, if possible, be made until planting is over. Please, if you approve, send orders at once about using the Ninth Iowa and Seventeenth Illinois Cavalry,and as to the dismounted cavalry form the depot.\n\nW. S. ROSECRANS,\n\nMajor-General."

Div. of the Mississippi, Nashville, Tenn.:\n\nDEAR GENERAL: You will no doubt feel much disappointed at not having General A. J. Smith's division returned to you in the time expected, but you will be reconciled when I assure you that the safety of this army and my whole fleet depend on his staying here. His is the only part of the army not demoralized, and if he was to leave there would be a most disastrous retreat. The army has been shamefully beaten by the rebels. There is no disguising the fact, notwithstanding the general commanding and his staff try to make a victory. Armies victorious don't often go back as this one has done. Your part of it maintained its reputation and saved the army from being beaten in the two days' fight. It is too long a tale to write, but some of these days I will give you a full and fair account of it. The defeat arose from sending 6,000 raw cavalry to attack an army of 25,000 men, said cavalry being accompanied by over 200 wagons. It was only supported by 2,500 men, and when these were overpowered by vastly superior numbers the cavalry fell back on them; the wagons stampeded and fell into the hands of the enemy. General Corse has heard it all and will tell you all about it. I was averse to coming up with the fleet, but General Banks considered it necessary to the success of the expedition, and I now can't get back again, the water has fallen so much. This has been terrible work; worse, if anything, than Deer Creek. There we had plenty of water; here no water, and thousands of sharpshooters. The gunboats has some satisfaction out of the rebels yesterday. A couple of brigades, flushed with victory, made an attack upon two of them, and, excited by liquor, fought like madmen, coming up to the edge of the bank, where they were what down like sheep. It is said we killed the rebel General Green, their best man.\n\nI cannot express to you my entire disappointment with this department. You know my opinion of political generals. It is a crying sin to put the lives of thousands in the hands of such men, and the time has come when there should a stop be put to it. This army is almost in a state of mutiny and not fit to go into a fight. They would follow A. J. Smith, though, anywhere. The more I see of that old gentleman the more I like him. He is a regular trump, and has no give-up in him. I have been up as far as Loggy Bayou, and there was brought to a dead stand by a large steamer sunk in the channel, resting on each bank. It was providential, or I might have gone farther, and would have been cut off to a certainty. I am not sure that Banks will not sacrifice my vessels now to expediency; that is, his necessities. I only wish, dear general, that you had taken charge of this Red River business. I am sure it would have had a different termination. I am very tired and must close for the present.\n\nWish best wishes, &c., I remain,\n\nDAVID D. PORTON,\n\nRear-Admiral."

Major Fitch was fired on both going and coming between this and Cassville. He says the cross-roads are thoroughly beaten by footmen and horsemen, and thinks that they are rebels from the marks and from information received. A messenger from below says Quantrill crossed with a party a few days since between Smith and Gibson.\n\nThe guns sent by you have arrived, but I must have more. I have given out every one to supply the immediate necessities of my own regiment and have not enough yet. Please send those called for last night, as well as 100 picks and 200 spades, to my quartermaster. I am fortifying, but lack tools. Trains between Cassville and this place should be well escorted. I will keep you informed of all movements. Goods for citizens had better be kept back for the present.\n\nM. LA RUE HARRISON,\n\nColonel, Commanding."

          "text": "GLASGOW, MO., April 9, 1864.\n\nBrigadier General C. B. FISK,\n\nCommanding North Missouri, Saint Joseph:\n\nDEAR SIR: We, the undersigned citizens of Glasgow and vicinity, take the liberty of addressing you this communication, to signify to you our desire to give you all the assistance in our power in your position as commander of North Missouri. We may congratulate you and ourselves that the district you now command, and of which we are residents, has so far fared well compared with many portions of our war-devastated State. We sincerely trust we may hereafter escape the ravages of war as we have heretofore done, but desire to state to you that we have grave apprehensions that such will not be the case, especially if there shall be any further letting up of military power, which alone has saved us. More or less troops have been in this section for two years past until quite recently. The rebellious spirit of the people seemed to be subdued, and the military force has been gradually withdrawn, but this giving up of the rebellion and its objects was only apparent, as is now evidenced by the increased and daily increasing boldness of rebels and Southern sympathizers.\n\nOur immediate section is much troubled with marauders; but few of the people stand out against them, a large number either being too much intimidated to oppose them, even in the giving of information, while by far too many evidently regard these outlaws as aiders of the Southern cause, and of course opponents of the Federal Government. This is evidenced in the fact that Union men, and men who have abandoned the Southern cause and evidenced a willingness to aid the Federal Government, are nine cases in ten the sufferers at the hands of these brigands. We cordially indorse the sentiments uttered in your telegraphic dispatch to the assistant provost-marshal at this place. That is the basis we have been striving to get people on for months past, but, we regret to say, with but little success. We are satisfied, general, as matters now stand, that unconditional unionism, such as we profess, will continue to grow weaker as the rebel spirit grows bolder, until it will not be safe for a free, outspoken defender of our Government to reside here.\n\nAnother fact we desire to call your attention to. Large numbers of people are moving from the south to the north side od the river. Of these there is an unusual number of women, children, and aged men. They are doubtless the families of men who are in the Southern Army, who have found the south side, where Federal troops are abundant and active, too hot for them, and hence their migration. In time their husbands, sons, brothers, and fathers (rebel soldiers) will follow them, and we may yet witness the scenes enacted in the border, southwestern, and southeastern counties. It is believed not a few of the men of these families are now on the north side of the river.\n\nWe submit the facts and our impressions, leaving the remedy to your superior judgment. We beg to add, in conclusion, that we believe the public peace and safety would be conserved by stationing at this place a company or part of a company of good soldiers commanded by active and efficient officers. Tendering you our well wishes for your success in the cause in which you are engaged, we subscribe ourselves,\n\nYour obedient servants,\n\nCLARK H. GREEN.\n\nZ. C. HUGHES.\n\nALFRED W. ROPER.\n\nJOS. A. LEWIS, M. D.\n\nJOHN TILLIMONN.\n\nF. W. DIGGES."

General, Thirteenth Army Corps:\n\nCAPTAIN: I have the honor to report that in obedience to instructions from the major-general commanding I did, on the 14th instant, cross Cedar Bayou onto Saint Joseph's Island with 70 men of my command for the purpose of making a reconnaissance and driving off horses and cattle onto this island. I went as far as the south end of Saint Joseph's Island and communicated with Major Thompson, commanding on Mustang Island. I made a careful inspection of the ground on the south end of the island to ascertain whether the detachment on Mustang Island might not be transferred to a position on this side of Arkansas, equally eligible for commanding (by artillery) that pass, and more eligible for a camp, and am fully of the opinion that it could not. The south and of the island for at least 1 1\\2 miles is very low, and in very high tides is covered with water.\n\nThis portion of it is also fully and perfectly commanded by the sand-hills on Mustang Island that come up to the water's edge, which hills, if occupied by the enemy, would command the pass. The channel is also near the Mustang side, while on the Saint Joseph's side the water is so shallow that it would be quite impossible for transports to make a landing and discharge their cargoes. In regard to the camp I have the honor to export that there is no eligible position the other side of Arkansas City, with is about 4 miles this side of the extreme point of the island. I found no enemy. I drove off 3 Government mules and 17 ponies, and drove to this end of the island about 1,500 head of cattle. I had made no preparation for swimming the cattle over Cedar Bayou, and owing to the rain that had recently failed could not drive them over the Salt Flats to the reef over which we had to cross, and have left them on this end of the island. I carefully examined the bay side of the island, and think there is no place the enemy can cross except in boats. The land on that side is very flat and boggy. I found about 100 wagon loads of salt on the island. Major Thompson had sent over a small detachment to drive in and butcher cattle for the of rope I could make a good ferry over Cedar Bayou, and if desirable keep up communication with Mustang Island.\n\nI am, captain, respectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nA. C. MATTHEWS,\n\nMajor, Commanding."

There are not a dozen loyal men (I mean what I say; they can't say shibboleth) left in Butler and Ripley Counties. They are about all driven from homer or killed, their arms lying idle; their families reduced almost to a state of starvation. A post of infantry at these places would answer almost as well as cavalry, for those demons can never be subdued by raids. Their paths must be watched. If an order was issued for every loyal man from eighteen to fifty to take up arms and scout the country until jayhawking was no more it would soon cease.\n\nIf neither can be granted, please inform your most obedient servants,\n\nH.

C.:\n\nI have sent an expedition, under Major General A. J. Smith, for the purpose of destroying or capturing the rebel force engaged in the attempt to interrupt the navigation of the Mississippi River near Greenville. General Smith has been re-enforced by cavalry and artillery from this command, making his force about 7,000 effective.\n\nThe rebel force is said to be about 5,000 and nearly all mounted. I am making arrangements to have water transportation held in reserve at different points on the river, so as to be able to move troops to any point threatened without the delay that is now necessary.\n\nED.

As soon as you hear that the companies of the Eighth have reached the post on James River, you will direct the four companies of the Thirtieth Wisconsin to march from that post to the Missouri River, to report to Brigadier-General Sully for duty. You will be notified in time to what point on the Missouri to direct their march.\n\nI have the honor to be, most respectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nJ. F.

BUFORD,\n\nCommanding,&c. Helena, Ark.:\n\nSIR: The major-general commanding requests that you will reduce the force now stationed at the mouth of White River to 50 men.\n\nVery respectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nGEO. S. MELVILLE,\n\nFirst Lieutenant and Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.\n\nIn compliance with it you will detail the captain most fitted to be left in a separate command with delicate duties to perform with one or more lieutenants and 50 men, with rations up to the 16th of June, camp and garrison equipage, and 100 rounds of ammunition to the man, and embark in the first steam-boat you can obtain with all the remainder of your command for Memphis, where you will report to Major General C. C. Washburn. I see by your morning report of the 28th that some of your companies are so small that you may have to detail two companies, or one company and part of another, to meet the requirements of this order. You will use your sound discretion in the selection, leaving the first and second in command, both calculated for a separate command. I inclose instructions for the officer you leave in command. You will please report to me as you pass this place.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nN. B. BUFORD,\n\nCommanding."

This was nearly a week ago. A company of Enrolled Militia that I had stationed at Lamar had been removed by some officer about a week ago without my knowledge. I ordered the company back immediately upon learning that it had been removed, but before it arrived some guerrillas came in and burned the public records and all the buildings, and destroyed some of the personal property of the citizens.\n\nAn investigation into the matter of the removal of the troops was instituted some five days ago and before the burning of the town. As soon as the officer ordering the troops away is known, I will put him in arrest and have him tried. Melville, as is the case with all towns now, was burned at once, after our troops were withdrawn, by guerrillas. The number of small-arms now in the arsenal here is 4,740. A building to store them and the ammunition in is already completed in Fort No. 1, and nearly all the arms and ammunition already stored there.\n\nThe stock is doing well now, but we need 200 or 300 cavalry horses. The crops are looking finely, and promise to yield enough for the purposes of the Government the coming year.\n\nJOHN B. SANBORN,\n\nBrigadier-General, Commanding."

          "text": "SAINT LOUIS, MO., May 30, 1864\n\nGeneral EWING:\n\nDEAR SIR: I have carefully read the communication of A. H. Lee to \"Dear Theopheli,\" dated April 7, 1864, at Prairie du Rocher, which is all erroneous and false, except the killing of 2 guerrillas. The following are the facts in the case:\n\nWhen I charged into the village several men ran from different houses and fled toward the bluffs, but a short distance (about 150 yards), the base of which is perpendicular rocks from 30 to 50 feet high; they ascended by a narrow defile which must have been known to them. As soon as they entered the defile or oblique passage they disappeared from my sight, and I supposed they had entered a cavern, and immediately gave orders, to have it guarded, and then proceeded to search for more scoundrels but at that instant we were fired upon from the bluffs by men who were behind rocks and trees.\n\nSome of my men returned the fire, while others charged up the cliffs and killed 2 of the gang and wounded another. One of my men was severely wounded. After the fight search was made through the town for others who might be hid. During the time several guns were brought to me by soldiers, who were ordered to take all the arms from houses where the guerrillas were seen to run from. I made repeated inquiries of the citizens if any of the captured guns belonged to them. No one claimed any of them at that time. Afterward I learned that some of them belonged to citizens, and I took measures to return them. I was near Mr. Blais' store all the time we remained in town, except about fifteen or twenty minutes, when I was on the bluff. My men all behaved remarkably well in every respect. No plundering or rioting was committed; if it had been I would have known it or heard of it at the time.\n\nA buggy was procured, as soon as possible, to convey the wounded man, when I left with all my command. Before leaving, when my men were all in line, I proposed to citizens to give three cheers for Lincoln, which ws responded to by about one-half of the crowd, which was composed of 80 or 100 men. Before entering the village I said to my command that we were on an important expedition, and that no citizens should be molested in any way without my orders; and while in town I took every precaution to see that everything was properly conducted, and have always been able to maintain good order and discipline in my company. Mr. Lee is a stranger to me, of whom I know nothing.\n\nMr. Blais is undoubtedly a copperhead, for a short time since, at an election in Prairie due Rocher, he took a Republican vote from a Mr. Levrie, with an oath that he (Mr. Levrie) was a Black Republican and a traitor to his country, and that he could not cast any such votes there; also, at another time he said that any man that indorsed the administration of President Lincoln could not stay about him.\n\nThis will at any time be sworn to by several citizens who live near Prairie du Rocher, and heard him say it. I cannot close without expressing my heartfelt thanks for the privileges extended to me while under arrest with such grave charges. At the same time I keenly feel the wrong and gross injustice done me and my company by the false communication of A. H. Lee and affidavits of Blais, Cooner, and Unger, and trust they will be compelled to make proper amends.\n\nVery respectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nH. B. MILKS,\n\nCaptain Co. H, Third Cavalry, Missouri State Militia."

General Weitzel, who so well knows the military situation in Louisiana, concurs in the suggestion. It can reach here in fourteen days to re-enforce army depleted by fresh battles to be fought in the mean time.\n\nB. F. BUTLER,\n\nMajor-General.\n\nE. M. STANTON,\n\nSecretary of War."

Ter.:\n\nSIR: I have the honor to inform you that I have just received from Major Wynkoop an order for this company to march without delay and report to the commanding officer at Fort Lyon for duty. The major says:\n\nI have received information that Lieutenant Eayre's command have nearly all been killed by the Cheyenne Indians at some place over on Smoky Hill Fork. I have already used all the means in my power to ascertain the correctness of the report and know not what moment I may be obliged to start with a large command to his assistance.\n\nFor the following reasons I cannot comply as promptly as I could wish with the foregoing order, viz: I have not a single team or wagon with which to transport the company and its stores, but am advised by Captain Backus that the company teams would leave Denver on the 25th instant. I will march as soon as transportation arrives unless orders are received to the contrary. Two sections of the battery left this camp on Wednesday, 25th instant, for Lyon.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nGEO. L. SHOUP,\n\nFirst Lieutenant, First Cavalry of Colorado."

HALLECK,\n\nChief of Staff:\n\nIn view of the time it would take to get orders to New Orleans and to transport troops from there here, I do not think it advisable to bring the Nineteenth Corps to this field. Since Banks' disaster, too, all the troops in the Trans-Mississippi Division may be required there. If there are any surplus troops West they could be advantageously used against Mobile, as suggested in Sherman's dispatch of May 30. Please so order. Let Reynolds of Franklin command the expedition. The sixty pontoon-boats coming from New York, with what we have here and at Fort Monroe, will be sufficient.\n\nU. S. GRANT,\n\nLieutenant-General."

STONE,\n\nGovernor of Iowa:\n\nSIR: A letter I received from General Pope last night informs me that it had been necessary for the War Department to order some of the troops from Minnesota to Arkansas, owing to the late disasters in that State and Louisiana ; and thus the force ordered to meet me from Minnesota must be greatly reduced. And he also proposes, if I think it necessary, to call on you for four or five companies of the new national guard as a protection to the frontier, whereby I will be enabled to take with me most of the troops I intended as a protection to the frontier of Iowa and Dakota.\n\nThese troops, if furnished me, would necessarily arrive so late that before that time I would as far up the country: therefore I should be obliged to leave a cavalry force on the frontier before starting. I have no infantry as a guard at different points, and I cannot increase my force by your sending me these troops; but if you could send two companies, to be stationed at Fort Randall, I could send the cavalry I have stationed there out on the James River, where they could do good service in breaking up small encampments of hostile Indians. Should you be able to send them, send me a telegraph informing me when they will start. My troops have mostly left here, and I shall follow in a few days.\n\nWith much respect, your obedient servant,\n\nALF. SULLY,\n\nBrigadier-General."

Yet, if the citizen guards really capture from the enemy any property, the general thinks under the circumstances no very strict accountability would be called for, unless in matters of grave and vital importance.\n\nJAS.

FISK:\n\nDEAR SIR: I assume the privilege of addressing the commander of my district in relation to bushwhackers in Ray County, Mo. From the earliest day of this rebellion I have been an active worker against traitors to this Government. There have been two raids made in this county in the last week. I, with a party of the loyal citizens of Crab Orchard, have been the first to the point of action. I, on the point of a raid being made on last Saturday night or last night got together 9 men. I took the brush. I landed on the Missouri River bank just at the dawn of day yesterday morning, and secreted my men at the crossings of these thieves. At 8 o'clock in the morning they sent a man out on the opposite side of the river; he halloed over. Just at that time I had been detected by arresting 3 young men who were passing the point where they had been swimming the river. This man who came out and halloed got on his horse and retired back into the brush.\n\nThey stole my horse the night of the 23rd. The marauders are threatening my store and life all the time, all, they say, for arresting Lewis Vandovier, as he was one of their friends. It is supposed in some circles that I am laying myself liable to be presented to the grand jury for passing through the country with armed men without any authority. Now, I ask you for your opinion on this point. Suppose, I or any of my men, kill a thief while acting in our own defense, what will be the consequences? The copperheads have the power in their own hands with the civil law in this county. They have not offered me nor the loyal people of this section any protection. We feel if we are protected it must be by our own strategy. Let civil law do as it may, we don't feel like letting the guerrillas assassinate and plunder us, and wait for the civil law to bring them to justice, for the civil law has never brought a felon to justice since the rebellion commenced. The rebels think it wrong for a Union man to sell goods in Ray County. I am attempting it with this fear, that when I retire at night I do not know but that I may be burned out or assassinated before the rising of the next sun, and that is the way Union men are protected here. I would be pleased to hear from you at your earliest convenience.\n\nI am, sir, your most obedient servant,\n\nABRAHAM ALLEN."

OF THE NORTHWEST,\nSaint Paul, Minn., June 2, 1864.\n\nMajor General JOHN POPE,\n\nMilwaukee:\n\nGENERAL: I have the honor to state that I received dispatches from Brigadier-General Sully last night, dated 30th ultimo, from Sioux City, which were transmitted by special messengers along the line of outposts in the unprecedented time of sixty-one hours and fifty minutes, the distance accomplished being full 340 miles. The principal object was to advise me of the march of his troops on the 30th and of a heavy concentration of Indian warriors near the mouth of Grand River, which would render it advisable that my detachment, instead of marching to the first designated point of junction at Bordache Creek, should move by Sully's old route of 1856, cross the James River at the mouth of Moccasin River, and strike for Swan Lake, unless other instructions should mean time reach Colonel Thomas by means of the scouts to be dispatched by General Sully to meet a scouting party from this side on Nicolett's trail to Fort Pierre.\n\nI dispatched a special messenger to Colonel Thomas with a copy of the dispatch this morning, and directing him also how to instruct the scouts to communicate with Sully's scouts by means of stones placed on commanding points along their route, in case they should not succeed in meeting with them.\n\nI have been delayed in my departure for Fort Ridgely by the non-arrival of General Dana, who only reached here yesterday afternoon. I have explained everything to him, and I think he is satisfied that it will not answer further to diminish the force on this frontier. I am about taking him to visit Fort Snelling.\n\nUnless there should occur something to prevent I shall leave for Fort Ridgely on the 4th. Colonel Thomas has been ordered to march on the morning of the 6th, and I wish to superintend the departure in person.\n\nI am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nH. H. SIBLEY,\n\nBrigadier-General, Commanding."

My force is not only entirely too small for the protection of Charleston and Savannah and the railroad connecting them, but some of the troops cannot be relied on. A part of a guard near Savannah over powered the others yesterday and escaped to Fort Pulaski. Many men of the First South Carolina regiment artillery and Lucas' battalion firmly believe that they are held in service illegally and are greatly dissatisfied, and desertions to the enemy are frequent. General McLaws considers the whole garrison of Fort Bartow unsound. I cannot place reliance in them. I beg that 2,00 infantry be sent me for service here and 1,000 for service at Savannah. With that additional force I believe I can hold the places against the force in my front. If not re-enforced serious disaster may soon occur. I have received no reserve force . Please bring this to the attention of the President and reply.\n\nSAM. JONES,\n\nMajor-General.\n\nGeneral S. COOPER."

These torpedoes have either already been placed in the Saint John's River or will be shortly unless active measures are taken against it. It appears also that the residences of that part of the ban of the Saint John's are used for the purpose of espying the position of our gun-boats and picket-boats on the river, and the movements of our steamers. You are therefore directed to send a force of men, not exceeding 200, for the purpose of scouring completely the island and point above mentioned, capturing any rebel scouts or pickets or torpedo layers, and especially one O'Hern, and causing all the loyal inhabitants to remove to the east side of the Saint John's, and all the disloyal to remove west and within the lines of the enemy. Especial care will be taken to find torpedoes and to gain information as to where they are placed.\n\nI inclose you four tracings* for the use of the commanding officer of the expedition.\n\nIt is recommended that row-boats shall be used for transportation.\n\nBy order of Brigadier General William Birney:\n\nEDELMIRO MAYER,\n\nMajor 7th U.

I cannot well be more minute without pointing out the very houses in which they are confined, and for reasons very easily understood I am sure that this will not be expected.

General, Northern Dist., Dept. of the South:\n\nSIR: I have the honor to report the firing upon Fort Sumter as still continued with good effect. The points against which our fire has been directed are, viz: First, the angle formed by the junction of sea and gorge walls; second, the right (enemy's) angle of the fort. The first-mentioned point has been much cut away, and, in my opinion, is the point against which the whole fire should be directed. The right angle of the fort has been cut away for about 8 or 9 feet. The progress made at this point, however, has been very slow. So many of the guns used in breaching have been disabled that I have ordered the fire of the remaining guns to be directed against the center angle. During this bombardment great inconvenience has been experiences from the premature explosion of shells, notwithstanding that all the projectiles fired were thoroughly examined before being filled, and the fuse plugs well covered with white lead previous to being screwed in; still these premature explosions take place. The plan of varnishing the interior surface of the shells, as recommended by R. P. Parrott, has not as yet been put into practice, owing to there being no varnish in the ordnance department. Twelve 30-pounder shells prepared in this way were fired without any premature explosions. This is not a fair trail, however, but as soon as varnish arrives from Hilton Head it will be more thoroughly tested.\n\nThe following guns have been disabled during the past week: Numbers 3 gun (200 Parrott), Fort Putnam burst July 25 at the 1,300th round. Numbers 4 gun (200-pounder Parrott), Fort Putnam, requires a new vent. Numbers 3 gun (200-pounder Parrott), Battery Chatfield, ditto. Numbers 2 gun, 10-inch columbiad (colored battery), has bad about 18 inches of its muzzle blown off by the premature explosion of a shell. This gun is still being fired, and will serve well for short range. One new 200-pounder Parrott is being mounted in fort putnam to replace Numbers 3 gun, burst. New vents will be placed in the guns requiring them as soon as material for bushing is received by the ordnance department.\n\nThe only reserve guns on hand in this district are, viz: One 300-pounder Parrott, for which there is no carriage or chassis, and one 100-pounder Parrott complete. There re no smooth-bore guns on hand at ordnance yard.\n\nThe following number of projectiles have been expended in the bombardment of Fort Sumter from July 7 to July 21, inclusive:\n\nFort Putnam: 764 30-pounders, 294 200-pounders, 173 300-pounders, 98 10-inch columbiad; total, 928.\n\nFort Strong: 1,146 100-pounders, 142 200-pounders;total, 1,288.\n\nBattery Barton: 729 10-inch mortars.\n\nThirteen-inch mortar battery; 91 13-inch mortars.\n\nNumber of rounds from each work: Putnam, 1,947 rounds; Chatfield, 928 rounds; Strong, 1,288 rounds; barton, 729 rounds; Seymour, 542 rounds; 13-inch mortar, 91 rounds; total, 5,525.\n\nNumber and kind of projectiles; 764 30-pounders, 1,509 100-pounders, 1,619 200-pounders, 173 300-pounders, 98 10-inch columbiad, 1,271 10-inch sea-coast mortars, 91 13-inch mortars; total, 5,525.\n\nGrand total, 5,525 projectiles.\n\nI remain, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nWM. AMES,\n\nLieutenant Colonel Third Rhode Island Arty., Chief of Artillery,\n\nNorthern District, Department of the South."

I wish, however, to be informed definitely whether the intention declared in your letter of the 13th ultimo has been carried into effect. If so, I would respectfully request information as to what portion of the city these officers are now confined. If this question cannot be answered for military reasons, will you inform me of the degree of exposure to which they are subjected; whether in the part of the city most, or in that least, exposed, or that exposed in a medium degree. I would also request you to allow one general officer and one field officer of the said prisoners to subscribe to and send me a statement giving me the kind and quantity of food dealt out to them, also the comforts afforded them in the way of beds, bedding, blankets, &c. The object of these requests is simply to ascertain the exact manner in which these officers are treated, that I may treat in the same manner a like number of your officer now confined in Charleston. I have not yet placed your prisoners in a similar position of exposure.\n\nVery respectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nJ. G. FOSTER,\n\nMajor-General, Commanding."

Forces at Baldwin:\n\nCOLONEL: The general commanding directs me to give you following general instructions:\n\nFirst. You will build an inclosed work for the defense of Baldwin. For this purpose he sends you 50 axes and 200 shovels. Make the abatis strong, cutting down the trees in the direction of the enemy's advance.\n\nSecond. Destroy as much of the Lake City railroad beyond Baldwin as possible. It would be well to send a strong detachment of complete the destruction over the south fork of the Saint Mary's, and complete the destruction of that work, besides burning all the intermediate trestle-works.\n\nThird. The enemy's breast-works toward Jacksonville should be entirely destroyed, but you need not burn the abatis, which is as good for us as for them.\n\nFourth. Be extremely careful to prevent all information as to your numbers getting to any of the country people. Let none of them come within your pickets to sell produce or for any other purpose. if they should penetrate send them under guard to Jacksonville. The family now there must all be sent to Jacksonville.\n\nFifth. The troops sent from you should leave some time between dusk and daylight, so that the demonstration of your force shall not be observed.\n\nSixth. The troops falling back should march by the railroad as far as camp Milton to avoid the swamps, and thence by the big road.\n\nSeventh. Direct them to entirely destroy Camp Milton. Those that are to come to Jacksonville must not make any very long halts for this purpose. They may confine themselves to burning the for this purpose. They may confine themselves to burning the huts and stables, but when Colonel Beecher comes he may halt there long enough to destroy all the works.\n\nEighth. The Third U. S. Colored Troops will start to-morrow morning for Magnolia, and will march by the Bellamy road to the railroad to Cedar Keys, opposite Newnansville, which they will reach some time on Saturday; they will then probably go down the railroad toward Gainesville. The other troops forwarded by you to this point will march so as to meet at Gainesville. I wish Colonel Harris, after visiting Starke an Waldo, to strike westward to Newnansville, he will use his direction as to the time of his joining the infantry, but must endeavor to do so on Saturday or Sunday. Tell him there is plenty of forage in Alachua and Marion Counties.\n\nNinth. I shall occupy with a force Magnolia and Palatka, toward which points and Baldwin all contrabands can be directed.\n\nAll pillaging must be prevented, but all horses, teams, vehicles, and subsistence may be regularly taken.\n\nVery respectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nM. BAILEY,\n\nCaptain and Assistant Adjutant-General."

If you desire to examine him, I shall take pleasure in placing him at your disposal. With regard to the enemy's iron-clads, he corroborates our own observations and former information, and states, furthermore, that they have no idea of coming out of the harbor, but are only to assist in preventing the entrance of our fleet. In running between Johnson and the city the iron-clads usually take advantage of the tide, as they can hardly make headway against it. The Chicora is three or four hours making the distance from Johnson to the city against a heavy tide. With regard to the effect of our late operations on James Island, this deserter reports that Fort Pringle was \"very badly used up\" by the fire of the navy; that the men called it a \"slaughter-pen,\" and could not be made to stand to their guns, but took refuge in the bomb-proofs.\n\nI have the honor to remain, with the highest respect, your obedient servant,\n\nA. SCHIMMELFENNIG,\n\nBrigadier-General, Commanding District."

HALLECK,\n\nChief of Staff, Armies of the United States:\n\nGENERAL: I have the honor to inclose you copy of communication+ received this day from Colonel William A. Howard, commanding Thirteenth Regiment New York Volunteer Artillery, and would respectfully suggest that this regiment, with the boats referred to, be ordered to this department. Colonel Howard has served with me in North Carolina, and it was on my suggestions that the boats were built. They can be of great service in this department, being particularly adapted to these waters, as they are of light draught, and can navigate the internal passages from Morris Island to Florida. There are other reason why I think the service would be benefitted by having these here, viz: First. They will answer for the purposes of transportation. Second. They can be used for landing troops, owing to their extreme light draught, being able to run quite up to the shore, and allowing the troops to disembark without employing surf-boats or bateaux. Third. They will be serviceable as fighting boats, at their sides are protected by bullet-proof iron plating, and are furnished with proper accommodations and arrangements for guns.\n\nShould it be deemed inadvisable to order the regiment with all the boats here, I trust you will be able to send me the two boats now nearly ready for sea in New York, with a battalion of the regiment. I am particularly anxious to have these boats ordered here, as this department was in a great measure stripped of steamers by General Gillmore for the transportation of the Tenth Army Corps from this place.\n\nI have the honor to be, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nJ. G. FOSTER,\n\nMajor-General, Commanding."

FOSTER,\n\nCommanding Department of the South, Hilton Head:\n\nGENERAL: I send with this a letter addressed by 5 general officers of the U. S. Army, now prisoners of war in this city, to Brigadier General L. Thomas, Adjutant-General U. S. Army, recommending and asking an exchange of prisoners of war. I fully concur in opinion with the officers who have signed the letter that there should be an exchange of prisoners of war, and, although I am not instructed by my Government to enter into negotiations for that purpose, I have no doubt that it is willing and desirous now, as it has ever been, to exchange prisoners of war with your Government on just and honorable plans. Our difficulty in the way of carrying out the cartel of exchange agreed on between the two Governments would not exist, that I am aware of, if the exchange was conducted between you and myself. If, therefore, you think proper to communicate on the subject with your Government I will, without delay, communicate with mine, and it may be that we can enter into an agreement, subject to the approval of our respective Governments, by which the prisoners of war now languishing in confinement may be released. I should be glad to aid in so humane a work, and to the end that there may be no unnecessary delay on my part I have directed an officer of my staff, Major John F. Lay, assistant adjutant and inspector general, charged with the delivery of this, to wait a reasonable time in the vicinity of Port Royal Ferry for you answer. He is fully informed of my views on this subject, and, if you desire it, will confer with you or any officer you may designate.\n\nVery respectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nSAM. JONES,\n\nMajor-General, Commanding."

Since the order returning the troops to their respective districts (an order of which no official copy has been sent me) I have troops enough not only for defense but attack. the Seventh and Thirty-fifth arrived safely in due time, and the battery got in last night. My clearing up of Nassau County relieves us from all fear of torpedoes, nor do I think that the enemy will ever attempt to gain possession of any point below Trout Creek (unless his force is greatly increased) so long as we have a battery and infantry with which to fall upon his rear.\n\nTo the best of my ability I have combatted the apprehension here of the abandonment of Florida, but the people are nervous, having been abandoned twice already after promises to the contrary had been made them. Our staunchest friends stood everything well until the battery was sent off. The removal of that shook their confidence. When it came back yesterday there was great cheering in the town. I mention this nervous apprehension of the people as a fact the major-general commanding ought to be fully informed of. My building a wharf on the opposite side of the river and erection of saw-mills will do more to restore their confidence than anything else expect the sending back of the troops.\n\nVery truly, your obedient servant,\n\nWM. BIRNEY,\n\nBrigadier-General, Commanding."

Forces east side of Saint John's River:\n\nCOLONEL: The general commanding district directs me to say that he sends you the steamers Alice Price and Mary Benton. He wishes you to embark your command and reach the wharf at Jacksonville before daylight, so that the men may be disembarked without being observed, and bring with you every available man and every boat you can find. He further desires you to relieve the men on picket duty from Picolata to Jacksonville, that they and their boats may form part of the expedition. If this is found to be impracticable before daylight, let it be done after daylight, as that fact by itself will not excite suspicion. The general further directs that when you reach the wharf at Jacksonville you will move to a point within the fortifications, to bivouac until further orders. A staff officer will conduct you. The general hopes you will bring him at least 1,000 men. The general says if you cannot reach Jacksonville to-night in time to disembark before daylight to-morrow morning, you can wait till to-morrow night, but in that case you will send back the Alice Price immediately, and the general will send her to you again to-morrow night.\n\nI have the honor to be, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nJOHN C. GRAY, JR.,\n\nSecond Lieutenant and Aide-de-Camp."

VON GILSA, Commanding Post, Folly Island:\n\nCOLONEL: I have received orders this a. m. to make such demonstrations in this district as to cause the enemy to concentrate his forces in Charleston. These demonstrations must be made at once in order to have the desired effect. You will therefore -\n\nFirst. Order the commanding officer of Long Island to show a number of men in his front, and with unusual life to cross over troops ostensibly, say about 2 o'clock this p. m., to Tiger Island, where they should hide away. He should, however, not send such numbers over as to make the enemy's fire on Tiger Island effective. The troops must remain there until late at night; must not return before 12. He should show his boat howitzer up the creek. Should fire from the fort at the enemy's outposts toward the chimneys at 2 o'clock this p. m.\n\nSecond. You will order a strong patrol over to Broad Island. The men should show themselves and remain there until 12 to-night.\n\nThird. You will order the commanding officer of Cole's Island to cross over at once with a force of, say, at least 60 men, to Battery Island. They should hide away as though taking a position as skirmishers. The howitzer should be taken at once to the fort on the right. A rocket volley should be prepared at the bridge on the right, and at least 30 rockets should be fired away in three volleys. Planks should be ostensibly brought to the bridge on the right, and the bridge on the left should be ostensibly fixed so as to alarm the enemy. The firing from Cole's Island should commence with the rockets and howitzer at 4 this p. m., and at 6 o'clock musketry fire should commence along the whole line.\n\nFourth. You will have the troops of the Thirty-second U. S. Colored Regiment ready at the wharf at 2 o'clock and embark them on the steamers order there for that purpose. Besides those of the Thirty-second you should have at least 60 veterans on these steamers. Three rocket-boats will be ready at the same time, and the men will report to you.\n\nIf the gun-boats should not go up, which they will be requested to do, the expedition will go without them, and start at 2.30 up Stono River. The boats will halt in the neighborhood of Battery Island, and land a small part of these troops there, but on the whole taken such a position as to leave the enemy in an uncertainly whether we will land on James or John's Island.\n\nThey will take shelter behind the piles and will lie in the river until late at night, not to leave before 12. The rocket-boat will advance further. You will furnish Captain Jungblut with 40 men, which he will command besides his company. They will attack the farm on the right bank of the Stono River, about 2 miles above Legareville. Captain Jungblut will received his instructions direct from the general commanding.\n\nVery respectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nA. SCHIMMELFENNIG,\n\nBrigadier-General, Commanding District."

CANBY:\n\nGENERAL: Brigadier-General Sturgis encountered the enemy, near Guntown, Miss., on the 10th in large force, and met with very serious disaster. His force consisted of 3,000 cavalry, 5,000 infantry, and sixteen pieces artillery. He was driven back with great loss.\n\nThe enemy had a large force of infantry, cavalry, and artillery. The cavalry followed up our force to within thirty miles of this city, and it is reported that a large infantry force is moving in this direction. Our loss will reach full 3,000 men, 12 pieces of artillery, and 100 wagons.\n\nThe artillery was not lost in battle, but owing to the continued rains for ten days the roads wee so bad as to compel the abandonment of wagons and artillery, first destroying them as much as possible.\n\nI had orders to send out this expedition for some time before I sent it, and delayed because I felt too weak. The last telegrams of General W. T. Sherman and General J. B. McPherson I inclose, from which you will observe that they were both deceived as to the force of the enemy. * I sent a larger force by 2,000 than Major-General Sherman declared necessary. Your dispatch of the 8th received, and your request in regard to boats will be attended to.\n\nI am, general, your obedient servant,\n\nC. C. WASHBURN,\n\nMajor-General.",

COULT,\n\nFifth Infantry California Volunteers, Commanding, Tucson:\n\nInformation has been cnveyed to the general commanding the Column from California that 1,000 head of cattle en route to the Rio Grande should have arrived at your post ere this. These you will send here as soon as possible, and such accounts as you get from Captain Fritz, now about leaving for Tucson, in regard to the water on the road, will guide you as to the size of the bands in which they will be forwarded. They must be accompanied by suitable escort of troops. For this purpose you will send on Captain Wellman, with the remainder of Company E, First Cavalry California Volunteers, and any other troops ordered this way. It is possible that your escorts may not be sufficiently numerous to enable you to send all the cattle. Send what you can with due regard to their safety adn maintenance on the road, and advise me accordingly. You will instruct the agent of the beef contractor to permit the commanding officer at Fort Bowie to take such cattle as he may need for the supply of his post for sixty days. Captain Fritz takes over a train of twenty wagons, one forge, and one tank. These are all to be returned here, either all together or divided among the detachments accompanying the cattle. Such transportation as is required for the troops will be furnished out of this train, and you will fill up th remainder with the clothing, keeping nt for the command at your post and letting me know how much you keep. Should there still be any transportation unoccupied in these twenty wagons, complete the loading with subsistence stores. You will also send here all Government wagons under your control except forty, which you will employ in getting your supplies from Fort Yuma, loading them as above. You are authorized to keep, in addition to the Fort Yuma train, such post trains as may be absolutely required at Tucson.\n\nI am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nJ. R.

Department of the Pacific, San Francisco, Cal.:\n\nCOLONEL: As considerable difference of opinion has existed, and does exist, in regard to the number of rebel troops that occupied this Territory since the commencement of the insurrection, I have taken considerable pains to set the matter at rest, and have the honor to transmit herewith affidavits made by reliable residents of this place on this subject. A few days ago a person named Ferguson passed through here en route to Camp Wright, from Mesilla. He stated to Major Coult, Fifth Infantry California Volunteers, that he resided in Mesilla from March, 1861, until last month, and the number of the Confederate troops in Mesilla never exceeded 270; that they belonged to Baylor's regiment, and that this was the force to whom Major Lynde surrendered 700 men in New Mexico. The command of Hunter at Tucson, and Baylor at Mesilla, comprised all the enemy's force in this Territory, viz, 375 men. A few of the miners at Pino Alto, for the purpose of self-protection against the Apaches, organized themselves into a company, and in order to obtain arms, ammunition, &c., from Colonel Baylor, they took the oath of allegiance to the Confederate Government, but in nowise formed part of its forces or took any part in its service. Mr. Ferguson, above referred to, is a brother of Mrs. Cable, at Oak Grove, San Diego County, and is now on his way there, where his affidavit can be taken if necessary. The statements of Stevens, Aldrich, and Gay are abundantly corroborated by the evidence of almost every person residing in Tucson during its occupation by the rebels.\n\nI am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nD. FERGUSSON,\n\nMajor, First Cavalry California Volunteers.\n\nP. S. --I have opened this to inclose copy of a scrap of a letter found amongst the records of Tucson (Post) from Colonel Baylor, which substantiates the statements in regard to the force of rebels in this Territory."

Henley, who was one of my predecessors, and who has sons owning farms in the valley. The letter had no signature, which, I think, was simply an omission. In an interview with our Congressman, T. G. Phelps, last evening, he expressed himself thus: \"See General Wright; inform him about the annoyances, the Indians that have been killed by the white people in the valley from time to time, the destruction of the Indian crops, their driving away the Indians, and threats to kill the rest of them if they don't leave, &c., and ask him to declare martial law in all the valley, for the whole is now an Indian military reservation. \" Colonel Henely informed me that before he surveyed the whole valley into a reservation and gave notice that it should not be settled on any further, more than half the settlers that are now in the valley were in it then. The truth is, there are not five good Union men in the valley, except my employes, as the several elections show.\n\nMr. Phelps thinks \"that when you see the necessity for such a course you will order sufficient troops to at once remove every man from the valley and then take possession of the same, and let them present their claims to Government for the damages sustained, and the Government will pay all loyal men for any such losses. \" If ever a case of military necessity of the kind existed this is one, and I make the above suggestion to you at the instance of Mr. Phelps. Should all the Indians be driven off, as I fear they will, a war of extermination will inevitably be the result, and it would be too humiliating on the part of the Government to be thus coerced into purchasing farms and provisions (which have been nearly all made by Indian labor) after they have thus killed our Indians and destroyed our crops. I would be pleased to hear from you on this subject at your earliest convenience.\n\nI have the honor to be, your obedient servant,\n\nGEORGE M. HANSON,\n\nSuperintendent of Indian Affairs, Northern Dist. of California."

C.:\n\nGENERAL: I have served on the Pacific Coast for ten years, the last year in command of this department. My duties have called me to nearly every section of this great country; from the sunny plains of the south to the farthest bounds of our possessions in the north. I have been called, either to battle with our savage foes, or to aid in the preservation of this beautiful land from the horrors of civil war. During this long period I have had ample opportunity of judging of the character of the people and the value to the Union of these remote possessions of the United States. Previous to the war with Mexico but little comparatively was known of this country; a few of our most adventurous people had found their way across the continent and taken up their abode either in Oregon or California; but when peace was restored, and we acquired California, and coeval with that event the discovery of gold mines, extensive and almost fabulous in richness, caused a large influx of population. It was not alone from the States of our Union that the people came; every quarter of the globe, as well as the isles of the ocean, contributed to swell the number. It will thus be seen that this country was overrun and occupied by people bringing with them and retaining all their home prejudices, and ill calculated to establish a colonel of loyal citizens eager to promote the prosperity of the country. Time and contact have done much to harmonize and smooth down the discordant elements of this incongruous population, yet the outbreak of a formidable rebellion in our land had a tendency to revive those sectional sympathies and attachments, which have prompted men to glory in the fact not that they are Americans but that they are from such of such a State, to which their paramount allegiance is due.\n\nHappily the number of men who thus ignore the authority of the Federal Government and declare their fealty to the State from which they came is small compared with thatare Americans, and who love the Union and are willing to risk their all for its preservation. Such was the character and such the division of sentiments on this coast when I assumed command of the department. I saw at once that to overcome all these threatening difficulties it was necessary to be watchful, vigilant, and firm; not create unnecessary alarm in the public mind by hasty and ill-advised acts, but to pursue the even tenor of my way, regardless of personal consequences, and feeling assured that such a course could nto fail to secure the respect of political parties of every complexion, and ultimately redound to the honor to our Government and country. If what little I have done has contributed in the smallest degree in preserving intact our glorious Union and maintaining unsullied our flag, I shall feel more than repaid. It affords me high satisfaction to inform the General-in-Chief that during all the period of my command in this department I have received the most cordial approval and assistance from the Governors and State officers, as well as from the most prominent citizens.\n\nVery respectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nG. WRIGHT,\n\nBrigadier-General, U. S. Army, Commanding."

I am advised at the same time that a memorial has been forwarded to Your Excellency on this subject. During the month of August intelligence reached me that gave evidence of disaffection among several of the tribes in this portion of the district, and as a precaution in the event of outbreak requisitions were made by the commanding officer of this post for increased supplies of arms and ammunition. William Kelly, esq., the assistant adjutant-general of Washington Territory militia for this section, was also advised to make requisition upon the proper Territorial authorities for ordnance stores suitable to about 250 stand of arms now in his possession. In pursuance of the communication referred to, and in furtherance of the views of the citizens of Lewiston, I have respectfully to recommend their application for arms. The request for troops will no doubt be referred to the general commanding the district, with whom the disposition of the military force in this district rests. I have officially advised him of the matter of this communication.\n\nI have the honor to be, very respectfully, Your Excellency's obedient servant,\n\nJUSTUS STEINBERGER,\n\nColonel First Washington Territory Infantry, Commanding."

          "text": "HEADQUARTERS HUMBOLDT MILITARY DISTRICT,\nFort Humboldt, October 19, 1862.\n\nLieutenant-Colonel DRUM, U. S. Army,\n\nAssistant Adjutant-General, Department of the Pacific:\n\nCOLONEL: In connection with my official report of the 13th instant I deem it my duty to lay before the department commander the following facts, learned by me in my recent visits to the Round Valley and Mendocino Reservations: For upward of a year that Mr. Short has been the supervisor of the Round Valley Reservation no funds that ever have been received from the superintendent, Mr. Hanson, for the payment of his salary, or that of the physician employed, or of any other of the employes, nor for the necessary expenses of the reservation. Mr. Robinson, one of the employes, told me that Mr. Short had already been obliged to use from $4,000 to $5,000 of his own private funds for these expenses. The grain crops of this year have been destroyed, and there are but few cattle left for the consumption of the 1,500 Indians stated to be remaining on the reservation. There are no means to purchase any supplies, and there is great danger of the Indians starving to death during the coming winter. To remedy the evil--the credit of the Indian Bureau being entirely exhausted--I suggested to Mr. Short to get some of the settlers to furnish the complement of supplies needed, they consenting to look for their payment to a special act of Congress to be passed for the purpose at the coming session, the Honorable Mr. Sargent to be requested to visit the reservation immediately in company with Mr. Hanson, in order that he might verify personally the necessity of the purchase and the justice of the claims, and satisfy the settlers that such an act would be passed. Mr. Short accordingly wrote to Mr. Hanson to have this done. In reply to the repeated application for funds, Mr. Hanson has always answered that no remittance had yet been made to him from Washington. It was suggested to me that al the settlers would be willing to seel out to the Government, leaving the whole valley, containing some sixty square miles, for an Indian reservation. One great objection to this scheme is that the valley has not river or runnign strea, which is everywhere almost an absolute necessity to the Indians for fishing and for bathing. But the principal objection is one that applies also to every reservation in the district, and I consider it a fatal one, that al the turbulent Indians, those whom it is one of the chief objects of the reservation system to withdraw from contact with the whites, anever stay on these reservations unless compelled to by force, adn that to prevent their escaping from Round Valley it would require an army of 100,000 men. On the Mendocino Reservation there are said to have been formerly several thousand Indians. Some months since the post commander at Fort Bragg reported to me that there were then about 1,000, but on my visit there I was informed that there are now only about 280 left. They go when they please; it is seldom ever known whent hey leave. The reservation contains forty square miles, and to prevent the Indians from escaping from it, roi from any other ofv the reservations, it would require a chain of sentinels to be kept posted entirely around it. Mr. Whipple, the supervisor of the northern station, told me that Mr. Hanson admitted he had received $14,000 from Washington for the payment of the employes and other expense of the Round Valley and Mendocino Reservations, but state that he had been obliged to spend all this remittance on the Smith's River Valley Reservatino (the purchase of which has not yet been sanctioned by the Government). Of this amount Mr. Whipple obtained from him $1,000, leaving some $6,000 due him and the employes, besides $2,000 to $3,000 owing to traders for supplies furnished.\n\nVery respectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nPITT,\n\nColonel Second Infty. California Vols., Commanding Humboldt Mil. Dist."

Ter., September 10, 1862.\n\nASSISTANT ADJUTANT-GENERAL,\n\nHeadquarters Department of the Pacific, San Francisco, Cal.:\n\nSIR: The act of Congress of February 20, 1862, the fortification appropriation bill, says, \"For defenses in Oregon and Washington Territory at or near the mouth of the Columbia River, $100,000, if in the judgment of the President the same or any part thereof should be advisable. \" I had not seen the above until a few days before I wrote you on the 27th ultimo. I do not know what action has been taken in reference to the same. The dispatch of Brigadier-General Wright of 20th of September, 1860, as well as mine of the 27th ultimo, contemplates the erection of batteries at the mouth of the Columbia. I hope that the above appropriation may be applied to commence them and further estimates be made to continue them. Whether they should form a portion of the permanent fortifications to be erected, the engineers could decide. you no doubt noticed that in the requisitions for heavy ordnance, &c., forwarded on the 27th ultimo, it was expressly stipulated that the vessel or vessels should be chartered to await at Astoria instructions as to where the articles should be landed. I suppose that one-half should be landed at Baker's Bay, near Cape Disappointment, and the other half at the site for a fortification selected above Point Adams. The object of this communication is respectfully to commend this matter to the attention of the general commanding, and to recommend that the time intervening before the arrival of the ordnance should be employed by the engineers in preparing said batteries. They cannot reach here before next summer under the supposition of the most favorable action of the Ordance Department.\n\nI am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nBENJ. ALVORD,\n\nBrigadier-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding District."

Army, San Francisco, Cal.:\n\nCOLONEL: In accordance with instructions I left Camp Drum on the 18th instant with Companies C and E, Second Cavalry California Volunteers. I have examined the country around Battle, Antelope, Deer, and Mill Creeks. From information received at Red Bluff I supposed that the Indians would be among the canons of the above-named creeks, but within a circuit of about twenty miles found no signs, except what were about three weeks old. Not considering that any good can be accomplished by remaining, I have directed Lieutenant Berry to send a detachment from his company to scout among the foothills in the direction of Chico, and if nothing can be discovered to return to the Bluff and report for orders. Information reached me yesterday that a settler living in Mountain Meadows had been killed by the Indians. I shall proceed with Company C in that direction and inquire into the matter, and after ecamining the country in that region shall go to Fort Crook by that route. I believe that the Indians who have been committing depredations in Tehama Country are roving bands, who make their raids and immediately retreat to the mountains, assisted in every way by those who are in a measure domesticated at the different ranches along the Sacrament River. And it is the opinio of every settler with whom I have talked that, so long as they are allowed to remain, there will be trouble. Some believe that the pet Indians are the ones who commit all the depredations, leaving the ranches for a foray, and as soon as any expeditions are sent out quietly return to their homes.\n\nVery respectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nHENRY B. MELLEN,\n\nCaptain, Second Cavalry California Volunteers, Commanding."

Army,\n\nCommanding Pacific Department:\n\nSIR: I have seen an order issued from the Department at Washington in relation to the treatment of prisoners who speak disrespectfully of the Government. I see likewise that you are about to appoint a military commission to act upon and decide the several cases arising in this department. How are we to bring such cases before said commission? Is there power; if so, where does it exist, to transport them across the mountains? Can we have a commission appointed for this Territory? Treason is very openly spoken here now since Colonel Connor's proclamation. The trouble lies here in the fact that there is only one company stationend at the fort, and they can raise a force any day more than sufficient to overpower them. To obviate this difficulty I can furnish you with two or three companies, or have them at hand subject to call if you can furnish them with arms. The arms that we had are now pretty much distributed to such companies as have and are now forming. I have taken pains to so distributue these companies as to secure the greatest efficiency in case of trouble. I am quite apprehensive that there is a band of guerrillas forming in this Territory to burn, rob, and plunder all of the loyal citizens they can reach. They formed under the pretense of going east to join the rebel army, and received material aid from the rebel sympathizers here to help them across. They now think they are lurking about the country, and threaten to destroy it. I am quite certain that these Indian difficulties on the plains are brought about by the interference of the secessionists. I am of the opinion that there will be a necessity for stationing troops from the Humboldt to Ruby Valley. There has been some bloody work there within a few days.\n\nI think a portion of the command destined for Salt Lake should halt in the neighborhood of Gravelly Ford until the emigration has passed. The depredations appear to be committed north of the line of marnnor's command; the troops keep the mail road and the emigration north. It seems too bad that so many should be killed so near their journey's end. You will know much better than I do what to do. I will inclose a copy of a letter from my Indian agent from Humbmoldt, showing the state of things there, adn I have to-day heard of much more bloody butchery. If I can procure arms I can put a thousand good men in a condition to render good and efficient aid in any emergency. Can I do it? I see a troublesome winter before us and am anxious to be prepared for it. How to be prepared and what to do are the points upon which I desire your counsel and advice. I hear the mutterings and desire to prepare for the storm. At the bottom of all these troubles are the cursed rebels. If we could send them all to Alcatraz the troubles would end. The sooner the work is commenced and consummated the better. If we could have those in our midst removed the exciting cause would be gone. If you will advise me in relation to, first, what is the best to be done with the traitors and how it is to be done; second, what can be done with the Indian troubles; third, in relation to arms, &c., I will be much obliged to you.\n\nI have the honor to be, your humble servant,\n\nJAMES W. NYE,\n\nGovernor of Nevade Territory."

Ter.:\n\nSIR: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of the 11th instant on the part of the citizens of Lewiston, and referring to their requirement of troops and arms for the ensuing winter. Impressed with the belief that preparations should be made in that portion of the district for the defense your letter suggests, [and] by other and frequent reports received at this post, I have some time since represented the necessity to the proper authority. Judge William Kelly, assistant adjutant-general of the Territorial militia, near Walla Walla, has in his charge about 250 stand of muskets, and during the month of August last he was requested by myself to make requisition on the Governor for 100,000 rounds of ammunition for that arm. At the same time, and in view of the contingency your letter now refers, requisition was made by myself for a supply of ordnance and ordnance stores for the garrison. Since the receipt of your letter yesterday, and in furtherance of your request for my assistance [in] the procuration of arms, I have written to the Governor of Washington Territory commending your memorial to his earnest attention and indorsing your views. Referring to the posting of troops at or near Lewiston, which forms a part of your communication, I have officially forwarded a copy thereof to the headquarters of the District of Oregon for the consideration of the commanding general, I am advised of the early visit of Brigadier-General Alvord, in company with the superintendent of Indian affairs for Washington Territory, to this post, en route to your city and Lapwai Agency, and reserve a representation of your requests for a personal interview with these officers.\n\nI am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nJUSTUS STEINBERGER,\n\nColonel First Washington Territory Infantry, Commanding."

WRIGHT:\n\nSIR: I am just in receipt of two letters from the supervisor of the Indian reservation at Round Valley, and two letters from other persons corroborating his statements, informing me that some of the settlers in that valley have in a clandestine manner from time to time during the growing season opened the fences on the Indian farms and turned in their cattle, hogs, and horses, until the entire crop of corn (over 100 acres) and nearly all the wheat, oats, and barley have been destroyed except about 500 bushels, whereas there should have been more than that many thousand in the aggregate. He informs me also that the settlers told the Indians that they had not provisions now to last them through the winter, so that they must steal or starve, and if any of their stock was missing they would kill every Indian; thus alarmed, they induced two entire tribes to leave, the Con Cows and Hat Creeks, and went with them part of the way. The supervisor had no troops to assist him, and consequently was compelled to submit, and he now expects every day they will drive away the remainder of the Indians. The settlers now propose furnishing me with supplies for the winter if our Congressmen will guarantee them assurances of payment for them and also for their land claims in the valley, so that they may remove and give up the entire valley for a reservation. Whether they have destroyed our crops in order to sell us their own surplus the facts and circumstances can only determine. I shall endeavor to get either Mr. Phelps or Sargent to visit the valley and see for themselves what is actually needed, that when in Congress they may govern themselves accordingly.\n\nMy policy heretofore recommended to the Indian Commissioner I have again urged in my last report, viz, to abandon and sell the lands of Nome Lackee and Mendocino Reservations, which are entirely unsuited to the Indian service, and enlarge Round Valley Reserve so as to include all the forks of the Eel River, thereby givan extent of mountain territory of twenty-five by thirty miles for hunting and fishing purposes, and pay the white settlers for every legitimate land claim they have in the valley, removingj them entirely beyond the line of the reservation. The mountain district included in the enlargment is entirely unsuited to white settlers' use and will give general satisfaction to the Indians. This enlargement would be locating the reservation in the northeast corner of Mendocino County and adjoining Tehama, where the Indians would be protected against the trespasses of white settlers hereafter by interminable mountain barriers, and upon this reservation could be collected and subsisted all the interior Indians of the northern district. The same can be said of Smith's River Valley for the use of every coast Indian. Ranges of mountains on its north and east which can never be settled by white men, only suited for Indian hunting grounds, constitute a barrier for the protection and safety of both races, with the Pacific Ocean on the west and south affording an entrance at Crescent City. The troops under Major Curtis, at Camp Lincoln, stationed midway between the settlements of whites and Indians.\n\nThe settlers' farms of this valley have also to the paid for, and the money arising from the sale of Mendocino and Nome Lackee Reservations will nearly or quite refund the money thus expended, and one-half the expenses of keeping up these reservations thereby reduced. It has been suggested to me by the Members of Congress, as well as other officers of Government, both civil and military, if you would write to the Secretary of the Interior, and the Commissioner or Indian Affairs, stating \"that you have been made fully acquainted with the policy of the superintendent of Indian affairs in the northern district in securing Smith's River Valley for the coast and Round Valley for the interior Indians, and that you fully indorse it good,\" as set forth in my last reports, it would accomplish much in securing the object desired.\n\nI have the honor to be, very truly, your obedient servant,\n\nGEO. M. HANSON,\n\nSuperintending Agent Indian Affairs, Northern Dist. of California."

They left in consequence of there being no food here for them. The to the valley, make the number of about 500 that have to be provided for this coming winter. There are but few cattle here that are in condition to kill. The quantity of grain on the reservation I think does not exceed 600 or 700 bushels. The potato crop is now harvested, but I am told it is short. This makes your supply of food totally inadequate to the number of Indians to be fed. Now, the question is, what is to be done? If these Indians are left in a starving condition they will undoubtedly kill the stock of the settlers, and that will naturally result in Indians being killed by the whites; and if a war of this kind begins no one can tell us where it will end. It may be very disastrous both to whites and Indians. Colonel Lippitt, of the volunteers, is here on a tour of observation; he looks upon this subject precisely as I do, and that is, that prompt and efficient action is necessary to avoid a great calamity.\n\nNow, in answer to the question, \"What is to be done?\" I will reply that there are surplus grain and cattle enough in the valley belonging to the settlers to supply you through the winter, and they will sell it to the Government on credit, provided they can be assured of two things--first, that the money will be appropriated next winter to pay for the supplies thus furnished, and that provision will also be made for the purchase of their claims and improvements, and the appropriation of the entire valley to the purposes of a reservation and the removal of the settlers from it. When I saw you last you informed me that Mr. Sargent had promised to accompany you in a visit to the valley. Now, there is but one way to accomplish these objects, and that is for Mr. Sargent and yourself to come here and give the assurances I have mentioned, and the whole matter can, in my opinion, be arranged in a single day, and this is, I think, the only method by which anything can be done. The settlers are very anxious, and will do anything in their power to assist you in providing for the Indians this winter, provided they can look forward with some hope to a period when their difficulties with the Indians can be terminated. I wish, now, to impress upon you the importance of coming, in company with Mr. Sargent, immediately, while there is yet time to provide for the winter. It will do no good to come unless Mr. Sargent is with you. His presence is necessary to give confidence to the measures proposed. Write to him that it is all-important for him to come with you; but I would not undertake to explain to him these plans in writing. It will be better to explain them to him here, where he will have no difficulty in understanding what is necessary to be done. Wrige to me when you will come, so I can make arrangements to be here at the time.\n\nVery respectfully, your obedient servant,\n\n----\n\n------"

Department of the Pacific:\n\nCOLONEL: I have to acknowledge the receipt of the copy of Brigadier-General Alvord's letter of the 10th instant, made official by yourself and addressed to me, probably, for my information. The act of Congress to which General Alvord alludes contemplates permanent defenses at the entrance of Columbia River, and in pursuance of that act I was directed by General Totten, chief engineer, to examine the several points at the entrance of the river and to prepare a project for such defenses, to be submitted to Washington for approval. The several plans and drawings, including surveys, which accompanied my report to the general, left here by the mail of the 20th of last month, and I am in hopes to receive further instructions from the Department about the 20th of next month.\n\nVery respectfully, I am, colonel, your obedient servant,\n\nR. E. DE RUSSY,\n\nLieutenant-Colonel of Engineers."

Army, Commanding, San Francisco:\n\nGENERAL: I have reason to believe there exists in this county a secret organization having for its object the embarrassment of the Government in the prosecution of the war. This spirit breaks out and is shown by cheers for Jeff. Davis and other disloyal practices. About a month since I applied to the Governor as commander-in-chief of the State militia, making the inquiry if anything could be done in the matter through the militia organization. We have as yet failed to obtain the desired authority to suppress this detestable crime. I now make application to you as the general commanding the U. S. forces on this coast, praying you to appoint a good loyal man to act in the capacity of provost-marshal, or any other that may accomplish the desired end, with authority to arrest and confine all persons guilty of uttering publicly disloyal sentiments in this county. And should you conclude to make such an appointment, I beg leave to suggest the name of and recommend Mr. D. O. McCarthy, of Sonora, as eminently qualified for the position, knowing also that the loyal people of this county (Tuolumne) would hail his appointment as a guarantee that the traitors' practices complained of would be effectually stopped.\n\nHoping you will consider the urgency and importance of the petition as sufficient excuse for trespassing upon your time, I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nA. M. DOBBIE,\n\nBrigadier-General, Commanding Third Brigade, California Militia."

          "text": "Talk of Brigadier General Benjamin Alvord to the chiefs of the New Perce Indians, assembled at the Lapwait Agency, Wash. Ter., on the 24th of October, 1862.\n\nI left Fort Vancouver to visit you before I had heard of the murders in your country. The report of them met me at the Des Chutes on my way up the Columbia. I have come to see you in order to assure you that the Government desires to do all in its power to protect you. Hereafter, as heretofore, every officer under me wll be directed to spare no exertion to afford all possible protection to you. Oftentimes this duty must necessarily be performed imperfectly, and your will, as heretofore, often find our intentions and wishes more satisfactory than our performances. You are entitled to this protection by the treaty. You are also doubly entiteld to this carte and friendship from your long and unwavering fidelity to our people and to our flag. You received with kindness Lewis and Clark sixty years ago, when they crossed the Rocky Mountains and wintered on the Clearwater. You were kind to Colonel Bonneville in 1835, and to Fremont in 1843. In 1847 you indignantly rejected the proposition of the Cayuse, after the murder of Doctor Whitman, to join in a war. In the spring of 1853 I was in command at The Dalles, and I learned that you again scornfully rejected the messages of the Cayuse asking you to join in a grand combination for a war against the whites. That war did not finally break out until two years later, when you refused to join them and aided Governor Stevens in safely reaching Walla Walla from the Blackfeet country. In 1858, under General Wright, in the Palouse and Coeur d'Alene country, some of you fought on our side, and we promised accordingly to fight for you against your enemies. You will never have a worse enemy than the whisky sellers and the bad whites who intrude upon your and commit outrages upn you and on your families.\n\nMajor Rinearson has been making war upon them as Captain Smith did a year or two ago. Lh, he is a warm friend to the Nez Perces. Major Rinearson shall continue to discharge this duty. He will remain here permanently, and will build a military post, and will no doubt continue hereafter, as heretofore, faithfully to discharge the task confided to him. It will be his duty to make all good Indians his friends by doing all he can to protect you when requested by the Indian agent to prevent the whites from settling upon your farming and grazing lands, to aid in the arrest of whites who commit crimes against the Indians, and to punish those who sell or give whisky to your people. When I first met Lawyer with Mr. Craig in 1853 at The Dalles you were then fortunately remote from the emigrant road, and I had hoped that thus you would have an opportunity of developing and cultivating those elements of Christianity and civilization which had by the aid of missionaris been planted among you. As one woshiping the same God and Savior, I must admit that I took a deep interest in the experiment.\n\nWhen encamped near The Dalles in May, 1853, your men were seen to kneel on the ground and say their prayers and worship in truth and sincerity the great God of Heaven. You won in that way my respect and regard. Could I have had my will, I would have raised a wall as high as the heavens around you to keep out intruders. It is very sad to find that the discovery of gold and the consequent rush of miners to this country should have brought such a mass of the very worst white men in contact with you, and thus impeded your improvement. Better if all the gold found there were sunk in the oean than that such injustice should be done you. In this unfortunate and unlooked-for state of affairs the best the Government can do for you is to provide, as it has, for the making of a new treaty, so as to compensate you so far as possible for the unauthorized occupation of the gold mines by our people. It is true that no amount of money can compensate you for your injured feelings. But the making of this treaty is not given to me. It is in other hands.\n\nIt will be my duty after a new treaty is made to aid the Indian agent in enforcing it. Some vexatious delays have occurred in executing the old treaty. A portion of the annuities were at Wallula as I passed there. The new superintendent, Mr. Hale, is an honorable gentleman, who I am sure wishes to do you justice. He had to send his bonds to Washington before he could get money for you. But that delay will soon be at an end. When the Pacific railroad is built, which the present Congress has provided for commencing, we can communicate so quickly with Washington that such delays will be at an end. Some of you and some of your sons will yet visit the Great Father at Washington on that railroad. Believe not the deceitful words of the cunning and slanderous men who say that this great Government has lost its power. The very reverse is true. Never was the Government so mighty and terrible in its power. Never did it have so many rifles or so many soldiers. It has a million of brave and gallant warriors in the field. In the very midst of such a war it makes a beginning, as I have already said, of a Pacific railroad. Owing to the delays interposed by the Southern States, that measure was never before started. The Northern people have all the country from here to Texas, including California, Utah, New Mexico, Nebraska, and Kansas--nearly all to the Mississippi River. You are under a great, a proud, a rich, and a generous Government, and never did we have more noble, patient, and faithful allies than the Nez Perces. It takes fire to temper steel. Temptation is the test and trial of virtue. If a Nez Perce's lodge will stand rain and storm and hail and burricane, it is then well pitched; it is then firmly secured to the earth. The sun may shine, but fair weather and sunshine are no test for it. It required al this severe and harassing treatment by the gold diggers to show how true and honest and straightforward a Nez Perce can be. Such fidelity shall always have my praise. We wish in return for it not only to be fair, not only to be just, but to be also as kind and as generous as possible toward you.\n\nBENJ. ALVORD,\n\nBrigadier-General, Commanding District."

HANSON:\n\nDEAR SIR: I again call your attention to the aggrievances which I have given you an account of in a former communication, perpetrated by a portion of our while population. In additino to what I have written you, I will briefly state that our supervisor planted 100 acres of corn, 50 or 60 acres of wheat, which has been entirely destroyed by our neighbors' cattle and hogs, and destroyed a part of other grain which has been raised on this reservation; fences have been let down at night and their stock driven in. Now, sir, what language can I make use of to awaken you so that some action may be taken to prevent these outrages? Winter is near at hand and nothing to feed our Indians. There are many other strong reasons I might add why some immediate action should be taken, but forbear with a single remark, that unless some steps are taken in earnest immediately we shall be obliged to leave the reservation.\n\nVery truly, your obedient servant,\n\nW. P. MELENDY."

CUTLER,\n\nActing Assistant Adjutant-General, Santa Fe:\n\nI have the honor to report that I have just returned from a personal inspection of the district down the Rio Grande as far as Franklin. At that point and at Hart's Mill everything is progressing satisfactorily. As I have communicated to the general commanding in a private note by last express, the animals, battery and cavalry horses and train mules at Camp Johnson are not thriving; in fact, they look and are lower in flesh than I have seen them on the campaing. With a wide extent of county to watch and defend, with comparatively a small command, the efficiency of the latter under such circumstances must depend greatly upon its mobility. I have deemed it, therefore, imperative to look up better grazing at some point adjacent to more substantial forage, and for the latter, when I see the absolute necessity of so doing, I shall incur the expense of providing sufficient to prevent at least the animals from getting too poor to be serviceable. The general commanding directed the invitation of proposals for 100 tons of hay delivered at Fort Fillmore and an equal quantity at Mesilla. The contract has been awarded at $30 per ton. As I may find it necessary to locate the cavalry camp at a point remote from Fort Fillmore, I respectfully ask permission to have the delivery of the hay for that point changed either to Mesilla or to whatever locality may be deemed most advisable. After detaching one company from Fort Fillmore to relieve the garrison at Craig there will remain but one at the former point. I beg to suggest that I can have matters much in hand by abandoning Fillmore, and askpermission to do so. To watch the approach by Fort Quitman, if a cavalry camp can be found near San Elizario, Captains Pishon and Wellman will be stationed there with scouting parites as far as grazing and water will permit. Captains McCleave and Shirland will alternately move out on that Fort Stanton route. The occupation of Fillmore seems under the circumstances useless, and is embarrassing in consequence of the posts in the district so far outnumbering the facilities for medical attendance. No progress whatever has been made in obtaining wheat and corn in the lower part of the district under the order of the general commanding that the people should sell their grain at $3 per fanega. An agent has been dispatched to that section for the purpose of buying the grain at the price named, and funds for payment have been placed at Franklin. I am in hopes of being able ere long to report greater success.\n\nVery respectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nJ. R. WEST,\n\nColonel First Infantry California Volunteers, Commanding."

To prevent any future stampedes by Indians you will habitually keep all your horses tied to the picket-line. They will be fed full allowance of hay and grain when on hand. You will also cause your men to cut green grass for them and feed then as much as they can eat, but they must be exercised. For this purpose you will drill your men daily for at least one hour and a half. Should there be any persns encamping near your station with stock, you will order them to guard their stock in such a manner as to insure their safety and prevent their offering inducements by their carelessness to Indians to prowl around your post to steal animals. Should any party refuse to comply with such instructions as you give, you will order them away from your station to such a distance as you choose. You may graze your animals within sight of your station where there may be good grass, but each horse must be held by a trooper by a riata, and each trooper must be fully armed and equipped and have his bridle ready to put on his horse, so that he can mount at once and follow any hostile Indians that may appear when your order them pursued without delay. The horses must not be grazed within wunshot of woods, chaparral or brush, where Indians can be concealed, and every man in your command must be ready at a moment's notice, night or day, to spring to arms. The horses when on the picket-line will be guarded by at least one armed sentinel in the daytime and two by night. You must omit no precaution to save your animals from being run off, or your post from being attacked.\n\nVery respectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nD.

Ter.:\n\nSIR: Reliable information having been furnished me that a small party of Indians contemplated an attack upon the Government train between Snake River and Fort Colville, I have the honor to report that I have this day dispatched Captain Taylor, First Washington Territory Infantry, with an escort of ten mounted men, commanded by Lieutenant Apperson, First Oregon Cavalry, to examne into and report the facts. The depot at Palouse Crossing was moved from the right to the left bank of Snake River by the agent in charge for safety, in his fears that he would be disturbed by disaffected Indians, and that the public property was in jeopardy. It appears that on the Fort Colville road there has been some manifestation of hostile movements toward the Government employes, and that danger exists to the property in their charge. I have deemed it proper to send at once, and before any violence occurs, a small party on the road to examine into the matter. Captain Taylor is at present unemployed, and [I am] indispposed to give him command of his company until I hear the result of his resignation. He has been selected for this duty. He is instructed carefully to examine into the disposition, temper, and character of the different tribes of Indians, or of individual Indians, bordering the route, inquire into the truth of the late reports, and lay the result of his inquiry before Major Rumrill, commanding Fort Colville, which post he is directed to reach. He is to be here on his return not later than the 26th instant, when all the facts will be reported to you. It is made the duty of the small force under Lieutenant Apperson, accompanying Captain Taylor, to act purely as an escort to the latter officer unless any attack is made upon the train. It is expected that the command at Fort colville will be enabled to protect its supply train, and the principal object now is to get authentic information for the commanding officer of that postting to the safety of the supply train on its present upward trip. The undersigned is impressed with the belief that the surest mode to prevent Indian difficulties in this district of country is to employ the available force of his command in crushing out at once the early evidences of disaffection and hostility. Intelligence of danger is rapidly communicated at this time, and promptness and celerity of movement on the part of our troops, with speedy and sure punishment, will I trust prevent any concert of action among the Indians involving general or formidable disturbance.\n\nTrusting that the general commanding the district will approve the disposition of the troops above named, I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nJUSTUS STEINBERGER,\n\nColonel First Washington Territory Infantry, Commanding."

By doing so a very great saving can be made in the cost of transportation, and in anticipation of approval I am now making arrangements for shipping the next supplies to one of the three ports in Sonora referred to, probably Libertad, from whence we shall have no difficulties to encounter in transporating the stores to Tuscon safely and economically.\n\nVery respectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nG.

Army:\n\nMAJOR: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of instructions of the 11th ultimo [instant], in which you say that the department commander desires me, as soon as possible after the receipt of it, to move with three companies of my regiment and the headquarters to New San Pedro. As I should not be able to carry out the orders fully, but only in part, I have thought it best that I should give you a statement of the difficulty in the way and await further instructions. In the first place there are no troops at Fort Barrett, the companies that were stationed there having been ordered from that post to Tucson some time since; nor are there any between this post and Tucson, except the few men at the express stations, so that, five companies of my regiment being at Tucson and beyond with General Carleton and four here, I cannot leave two companies here if three are to go with me. Then, again, as Lieutenant-Colonel Dobbins is under arrest, in consequence of an unfortunate affair between him and some other officers of the regiment, and charges of a grave character have been preferred against him, which you will receive by the mail with this, there is no field officer to take command of the post, as I respectfully submit there should be, considering its importance and the vast amount of Government stores almost constantly arriving here. As these facts were not known to you and are matters of moment, I hope the course which I have pursued under the circumstances will meet the approval of the general commanding the department.\n\nVery respectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nG. W. BOWIE,\n\nColonel Fifth Infantry California Volunteers, Commanding."

I have the honor now to apprise you that I am empowered, as superior military chief commanding in this district, to comply with such demands for the surrender of criminals in accordance with the terms of said treaty as you shall make upon me. The difficulties in the way of compliance with this convention of our respective Governments which you seem to anticipate do not suggest themselves to my mind. If you will be so good as to appriseure, I shall be much pleased to adopt proper measures to obviate them. In the meantime the responsibility will be assumed on my part of surrendering to your demand persons duly charged in accordance with the terms of said treaty with the larceny of property of less value than $25. One such case, that of Nicholas Flores, is now within my authority. On the 3rd instant I had the honor to address you a note in regard to him. As no reply has been received from you the note may have miscarried. He will be delivered upon your requisition.\n\nTrusting to find you disposed to exert your authority in every way toward the suppressing of the disorders which unfortunately prevail upon the frontiers of our territories, I am, sir, with much respect, your obedient servant,\n\nJ.

You will withdraw from Fort Barrett one company of your regiment, which, with the one left by you, will constitute the garrison of Fort Yuma, under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Dobbins. You will bring with your command one of the two ambulances at Fort Yuma. The general suggests as a better plan to send your command over by companies, and if you have not transportation for all, the first company will be sent as far as Camp Wright, and the transportation can return to Fort Yuma for the balance. District headquarters will after your arrival be established at the camp near New San Pedro.\n\nVery respectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nR. C. DRUM,\n\nAssistant Adjutant-General."

These Indians belong to the Umatilla Indina Reservation, but do not recognize their treaty obligations. They have refused to allow white men to settle in the valley, and have already driven away several men by threats of violence. Should those Indians be permitted to remain where they are at present congregated, difficulties of a serious character must occur between them and the white settlers. If two or three of the leaders of the party are captured at once and placed in confinement in the guard-house at Fort Walla Walla the whole affair may be checked and no further trouble in that quarter be apprehended. I have also respectfully to request that when the infantry detachment at the reservation is relieved a detachment of twenty mounted men may take their place, to remain permanently, for the preservation of peace and good order on the reservation. The great influx of travel to the mines directly through the reservation causes much dissatisfaction in the minds of the Indians and renders it absolutely necessary that a small force be kept constantly at the agency.\n\nI am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nWILLIAM H. BARNHART,\n\nU. S. Indian Agent, Umatilla Reservation.\n\nApproved.\n\nWM. H. RECTOR\n\nSuperintendent Indian Affairs."

About two miles from Simmons' ranch I was attacked by a party of Indians. As soon as they fired they tried to surround me. I returned their fire and retreated down the hill. A portion of them cut me off and fired again. I returned their fire and killed one of them. They did not follow any farther. I will start this evening for my post as I think it will be safer to pass this portin of the country in the night. Those Indians were lurking about of rthe purpose of robbing Cooper's Mills. They could have no othe robject, and I think it would be well to have eight or ten men stationed at that place, as it will serve as an outpost for the settlement, as well as a guard for the mills. The expressmen disobeyed my orders by starting without me this morning.\n\nI have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nH.

In consequence of the representatinos of some of the inhabitants of the outskirts of Arcata, instead of bringing Company I to this post I have halted it at Camp Curtis, near that place, where it is now stationed. To embark that company and the one at Fort Humboldt, twenty-four hours' notice would suffice, but to embark the companies at Fort Gaston and Fort Baker (Captain Morton's and Captain Flynn's) four days' notice at least would be required. The supply of the companies of montaineers will employ all, or nearly all, the pack-mules at this post. The distance to Captain Douglas' command in Round Valley is 150 miles. If it is to be supplied from this post nearly the whole, perhaps quite the whole, of the transportation will have to be hired. If it is intended that I shall forward supplies thither, I request an instruction to that effect by the next steamer.\n\nI have the honor to be, very respectfully your obedient servant,\n\nFRANCIS J. LIPPITT\n\nColonel Second Infantry California Vols., Commanding Humboldt Mil. Dist.\n\nLieutenant Colonel R. C. DRUM,\n\nAssistant Adjutant-General, Department of the Pacific."

Commanders of towns will at once establish sanitary regulations, and require them to be observed by the inhabitants and by the troops, so far as the policing of the streets and the keeping of their dwellings, quarters, stores, corrals, &c., in a state of cleanliness may be necessary to their health and comfort. Frequent inspections will be made by commanding officers or by a medical officer under his direction, to see that in all respects these regulations are followed.\n\nII. It is expected that all of the inhabitants living along the Rio Grande southward from the Jornada del Muerto to Fort Bliss, in Texas, will, at the earliest practicable moment, repair their dwellings and clean up their streets.\n\nThe people may now rest assured that the era of anarchy and misrule - when there was no protection to life or property, when the wealthy were plundered, when the poor were robbed and oppressed, when all were insulted and maltreated, and when there was no respect for age or sex - has passed away; that now, under the sacred banner of our country, all may claim and shall receive their just rights. Therefore let the burden of anxiety be lifted from their hearts, and once more let them pursue their avocations with cheerfulness, and with the full confidence that the protection which now shelter them from injustice will always be stronger in proportion as they shall bepowerless to protect themselves.\n\nThe success of the march of this column was dependent upon two things: First, the endurance of the men; second, the care taken of them. From the first organization of the column the constant care of General Carleton was given it; the health of the men, first, discipline next. Constantly watchful, the minutest detail received his personal attention. Every movement was based upon calculation; nothing avoidclear head, sound judgment, indomitable will, and perseverance. All these General Carleton possesses in an eminent degree. It will not be too much to say that there are probably few men in the United States Army so well fitted to command an expedition of this kind. A military experience of more than twenty years, a great portion of it spent on our frontiers, hasmade him familiar by experience with the wants and requirements of men in desert marching. In this march everything was reduced to the smallest possible compass. No tents were used by officer or men during the whole march. Two wagons were allowed to a company. In these were carried camp and garrison equipage, ten days' rations, mess furnisture - everything belonging to a company. Every article was weighed. Officers, from the general down, carried but eughty pounds of baggage, including bedding, mess kit, &c. The troops suffered very little from sickness. The morality was very small. Not one single death occurred on the march of the column from the Pacific Ocean to the Rio Grande, from the 13th of April to the 8thn of August, and but five deaths from dicease in hospital durintg this time - two at Fort Barrett and three at Tucson. Every possible care was observed to guard against sickness. This, together with the splendid material of the men, will account for the success of the expedition and the slight mortality from disease attending it. General Carleton, on relinquishing the immediate command of the column, published the following general order, viz:"

          "text": "IN CAMP AT LONE PINE,\n\nOwen's River Valley, July 1, 1862.\n\nSIR: I have the honor to report to the colonel commanding at Camp Latham that I arrived at Owen's Big Lake on the 24th day of June, 1862, at 2 p. m., having made a forced march of thirty-five miles on the last day. Owing to my rapid movement, on the 24th I surprised a party of Indians that were gathering worms from the shore of the lake, killed 2 men and took 2 men, 7 squaws, and 2 children prisoners, together with a large quantity of Indian food, grass, nuts, seeds, worms, &c. I laid over on the 25th to rest my animals, and at night, leaving my wagons with a strong guard, took 120 men and made a forced march of forty-five miles to the Stone Fort, so called, situated on Little Pine Creek, on the western side of Owen's River, at which place it was represented to me, both by the Indians and the whote citizens, there was a large body of Indians, some estimating at 1,000 strong. I reached the fort between daylight and sunrise on the 26th, and found that the Indians had scattered to the hills or mountains after having destroyed the fort by burning everything that could burn, and then throwing down the stone walls. For the last five days I have [been] scouring the valley in every direction, and am only the more convinced that the opinion formed by myself (and expressed in my official report to the general commanding the Department of the Pacific), from actual observation, when last here, as to the necessity of a post being established in this valley, was entirely correct. The Indians claim the valley as belonging to them, and still insist upon it that no white man shall settle, or, as they term it, sit down in the valley. They say that the whites may locate in the hills and work the mines, but must not sit down on the grass patches. Now, without arguing the point as to their right by prior location to the exclusive use of the valley, I will say that it is very evident to my mind that the mines will be of small value unless the valley can be settled and grain and vegetables grown and beef raised to feed the minesr with. It ia also evident from actual experiment that these Indians cannot be brought to the sticking point; that no fight can be had with them, and that they cannot be caught and chastised in a week or in a month, or if at all for the reason that the valley from Owen's Big Lake up his ear 150 miles long, varying in width from five to fifteen miles, with almost impassable mountains on either side, and the valley being open country, without a tree, the Indians can place their lookouts upon the peaks of the mountains along the valley and signalize the appearance of troops for twenty or thirty miles ahead approach they can and will scatter into the hills, where it is impossible to follow them. These Indians subsist at this season of the year to follow them. These Indians subsist at this season of the year entirely upon the grass seeds and nuts gathered in the valley from the lake up, and the worms gathered at the lake. They gather this food in large quantities during the summer and prepare it for winter use, which, together with the pinon nuts gathered in the mountains in the fall of the year, is their only subsistence. Without this food gathered and laid up they cannot possibly through the winter. From the facts set forth above, the nature of these Indians and the surrounsing country, it does seem to me that the only way [in] which they can be chastised and brought to terms is to establish at least a temporary post, say for one winter, at some pointnear the center of the valley, from which point send and keep scouts continually ranging through the valley, keeping the Indians out of the valley and in the hills, so that they can have no opportunity of gathering and preserving their necessary winter supplies, and they will be compelled to sue for peace before spring and grass come again. The actual settlers here that have come into the valley since my arrival, so far as I have heard them express themselves, are unanimously of the opinion that as soon as the troops leave the valley that soon they will either have to band themselves together to protect their lives and property, or else again abandon the country to the Indians, either course being to their ruin. As you will observe from the date of this report, to-day is the 1st of July, consequently the eighteen days (from the 12th June) for which the command brought rations with them was out yesterday. The remaining forty-two days' provisions of the sixty for which rations were issued being in the wagons of Mr. Banning, hired by your regimental quartermaster, not having arrived (although I have been here with my teams five days), I am entirely out of commissary stores, and shall be compelled to subsits my men upon fresh beef alone until they do come. I am afraid that my opeinion expressed to you and Mr. Banning at Camp Latham to the effect that no teams could haul 4,000 pounds up through this country and make any kind of traveling time has proven too true, and that the teams of Mr. Banning have broken down, and possibly have been compelled to lighten up by caching a part of the stores on the road in order to get to me at all.\n\nRespectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nGEO. S. EVANS\n\nLieutenant WILLIAM FORRY,\n\nAdjutant Fourth Infantry California Vols., Camp Latham, Cal."

          "text": "HDQRS. SECOND CAVALRY CALIFORNIA VOLUNTEERSE,\n\nCamp Douglas, Utah, November 28, 1862\n\nLIEUTENANT: I have the honor to report that agreeable to instructions of the colonel commanding the district, I left this camp on the night of the 20th instant and proceeded to Cache Valley, where I arrived about 11 p. m. on the 22d, a distance of 100 miles, where I was met by Mr. Van Orman, the uncle of the emigrant boy your ordered me to rescue from the Indians; he informed me that Chief Bear Hunter was encamped with thirty or fortyof his tribe, Shoshones, Snakes, and Bannocks, about two miles distant. I left the horses in the settlement called Providence in charge of a guard, and started about 1 o'clock for the Indian camp; the night was dark and cold, and we did not find the camp until the mornign of the 23d. I then divided my command into three parties under Captain Smith, Lieutenant Conrad, and myself, with instructions to surround the camp and close in upon them at daybreak. I found in a tenth tow squaws; the Indians had all left that night, as perceived that the fires in their huts were not extinguished. I then returned to where I had left the horses, at which place I arrived about 7 a. m. Captain Smith brought in one Indian, caught in trying to escape; I made a prisoner of him. About 8 o'clock a party of mounted Indians, I should think thirty or forty, armed with rifles, bows and arrows, made their appearance from a canon on a bench between the settlement and hills, about a mile from the settlement, and made a warlike display, such as shouting, riding in a circle, and all sorts of antics known only to their race. I immediately ordered my men to mount, divided them as before, sent Captain Smith to the right, Lieutenant Conrad to the left, and I took the center, driving the Indians into the canon; when I arrived a the mouth of the canon I halted for the purpose of reconnoitering just at thans opened fire upon Lieutenant Conrad; I then ordered my men to commence firing and to kill every Indian they could see; by this time the Indians had possession of the canon and hills on both sides. I found it would be impossible to enter the canon without exposing my men greatly. I therefore re-enforced Lieutenant Conrad on the left of the canon, with orders to take the hill on the left of the canon at all hazards. About the time the re-enforcements reported to him, Chief Bear Hunter made his appearance on a hilltop on the rihgt, with a flag of truce (as I was informed afterward); I at the time took it to be a warlike demonstration; a citizen who heard his halloing came up to me and told me that the chief said they did not want to fight any more. I then ordered my men to cease firing, and told him to say to the chief if they would surrender and come in I would not kill them, which terms they acceded to. Chief Bear Hunter, with twenty or more of his warriors, then came in. I took them into the settlement, took Bear Hunter and four others that I thought to be prominent Indians and examined them (through an interpreter) as to the whereabouts of the white boy, and ascertained that he had been sent away some days before. I told Bear Hunter to send some of his tribe and bring the boy to me; that I should hold the five as hostages until they delivered him to me. He dispatched three of his men, and they returned the next day about noon with the boy. I then released Bear Hunter and the four others. I killed 3 and wounded 1 Indian in the fight. I was told by Bear Hunter that an Indian known as Woeber Tom, alias Utah Tom, communicated the infromation of our approach. In relatiopn to the emigrant stock I was ordered to examine into and bring into camp, I could not find any such, and from the information I could gather I am of the opinion all or nearly all of the stock taken by the Indians last summer is now in the Humboldt country. I left Cache Valley on the morning of the 25th, and arrived at this camp on the afternoon of the 27th, without the loss or scratch of man or horse. It affords me great pleasure to report to the colonel commanding the good conduct of the command, and during the fight, which lasted about two hours, the officers and men behaved handsomely.\n\nVery respectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nEDWARD McGARRY,\n\nMajor, Second Cavalry California Volunteers.\n\nSecond Lieutenant THOMAS S. HARRIS,\n\nSeifornia Volunteers,\n\nActing Assistant Adjutant-General, District of Utah."

Ter., September 29, to proceed thence on the next day (the 30th) with Company H, Second Cavalry California Volunteers, on the northern Overland Route, via the \"City of Rock,\" in quest of guerrillas or hostile Indians supposed to have congregated there, I have the honor to report that, having left Fort Ruby on the day specified, I overtook on the second day's march, Captain S. P. Smith, of the Second Cavalry, who preceded me with his company the day before, and who was encamped in Pine Valley. Here I remained awaiting the return of the Indians who accompanied Captain Smith, and who had been sent out by him to bring in hostile Indians. Having been informed that fires were seen near our camp, I dispatched Captain Smith with a portion of his company, at night, to learn of them. He turned next morning and reported, \"No trace of Indians. \" On the morning of the 4th we took up the line of march, on the route designated, and arrived at Gravelly Ford on the 5th without having discovered any Indians. Here on the 7th I sent Captain Smith and Lieutenant Darwin Chase with a party of men down the river, and Lieutenant George D. Conrad up t the Humboldt, with instructions to scour the country for hostile INdians or guerrillas, and to report to me, at a place desingated, on the north side of the Humboldt, where I encamped on the 9th with the blance of the command. This evening (the 9th) some of the command enticed into the camp three Indians; two of them were armed with rifles and the other with bow and arrows. I immediately ordered their arms taken from the, and placed them under a guard, intending to retain them until the arrival of my interpreter, who was with the detachment under Lieutenant Conrad. A short time after their arrest the Indians made an attempt to obtain their arms, and, having succeeded, they resisted the guard and broke and ran a short distance; they were fired upon by the guard and crippled. Fearing that they would escape, and not wishing to hazard the lives of my men in recapturing them alive, I ordered the guard to fire any they were killed on the spot. Here on the 10th Captain Smith joined the command, and reported that he had received no information nor had he seen any signs of guerrillas or hostile Indians.\n\nOn the 11th I proceeded on the march, having sent out the officers of the command with instructions that if Indians were found to bring them into camp. Captain Smith, having been sent in advance, had not proceeded more than ten or twelve miles when he came upon a party of about fourteen or fifteen Indians, who were armed with rifles and bows and arrows. He surrounded them and took from them their arms. Immediately after, the Indians attempted to escape by jumping in the river. They were fired upon adn nine of them killed. On the same day Lieutenant Conrad and party brought into camp three Indans and an Indian child. Captain Smith returned in the evening with two squaws. Next day (the 12th) Captain McLean returned, bringing in one Indian and a squaw. Same day Lieutenant Clark returned with one Indian; another Indian was captured during the evening. The next day (the 13th) I told two of the Indians, through the interpreter, that if they would go and bring in Indians who were engaged in the massacre of emigrants I would release them, but that if they did not return that night I would kill all the Indians I held as prisoners in camp. The next morning (the 14th) hearing nothing from the Indians I had sent out the day previous, I put to death four of those remaining, and released the squaws and child, telling them that we were sent there to punish Indians who were engaged in the massacre of emigrants, and instructed them to tell all the Indians that if they did not desist from killing emigrants that I would return there next summer and destroy them. On the next day (the 15th) I sent Lieutenants Chase and Conrad with a detachment on the south side of the Humboldt with instructions as before. They came upon a party of Indians encamped in the mountains, armed with rifles and bows and arrows. They were surrounded and their arms taken from tehm. The Indians, attemptin to escape, were fired upon, when eight of their number were killed. The balance of the route no traces of Indians were seen. On the 28th I arrived at the place designated by you; the next day, at about 3 o'clock p. m. arrived at this camp. The route is a good one, with a abundance of grass and water. In conclusion, it affords me great pleasure to report the efficiency of the officers and the good conduct of them men of the command without the loss of any.\n\nr to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nEDWARD McGARRY,\n\nMajor, Second Cavalry California Volunteers.\n\nColonel P. EDWARD CONNOR,\n\nThird Infantry California Volunteers.\n\nCommanding District of Utah, Camp Douglas, Utah."

Detailed reports of each day's operations have been received from the following officers in command of scouting detachments, viz: Captains Theller, Short, and Flynn, and Lieutenants Smith, Gonnisson, and Campbell. These reports, together with that of a party under my own command, prove that the troops have zealously endeavored in the face of great difficulties to achieve success. The result, however, is very meager. Some 8 or 10 squaws and children and 1 buck taken in the Mattole region by the detachment from H Company. This detachment was in the mountains and absent from this post forty-one days, enduring great hardships. Captain Short, as well as Lieutenants Smith and Campbell (who releived the captain on the twenty-seventh day, his resignation having been accepted), deserve great credit for their perseverance under the circumstances. In fact, all the parties out during the past six weeks have suffered severely from the violent snow-storms which have prevailed. Many of our men have returned to the camps with frozen feet and exhausted by fatigue, and in many cases their shoes being torn from their feet, they attempted to protect them by wrapping pieces of their clothes about them. The officers in their reports testify to the unmurmuring endurance of these hardships by their commands, and I can attest to the same as regards my own party. We were led to hope that the winter season would be the most favorable for hunting Indians, but the experience of the past two months has proved that hope fallacious. The frequent violent storms in these mountains, and the consequent falling of snow covering all trails and signs, render it all but impossible to operate with any prospect of success. Two citizens brought to this post on the 22nd ultimo ten Indians from laqua Ranch, who had surrendered themselves their object being, probably, to secure comfortable winter quarters, knowing they could easily escape from Smith River Reservation in the spring. Since pay-day desetions from the different posts have been numerous. As far as heard from the aggregate is twenty-five, of which only eight have as yet been arrested. This result was anticipated as the great accumulation of pay enabled the men to procure outside aid. The pursuing parties from Fort Gaston have already in custody three citizens for aiding deserters to escape and we are on the track of others in this vicinity. There have been no recent outrages by Indians reported except the burning of two or three unoccupied buildings at Minor's on the Redwood near Fort Anderson. The colonel commanding the district arrived at this post to-day at about 3 p. m.\n\nVery respectfully your obedient servant,\n\nJAS. N. OLNEY,\n\nLieutenant Colonel Second Infantry California Volunteers, Commanding\n\nLieutenant Colonel R. C. DRUM,\n\nAssistant Adjutant-General, San Francisco."

Currey, First Oregon Cavalry, returned last night with a detachment of his company from an expedition to the Grande Ronde Valley. The instructions given this officer, as heretofore reported, were to find out the Indians engaged in the disturbances reported by the superintendent of Indian affairs for Oregon and the agent of the Umatilla Reservation, and if possible arrest and bring to this post a few of the most active and influential of their number. As by the captain's report, the effort to carry out the orderse given was met by resistance, and resulted in the killing of four Indians among whom was their leader, Tenounis, or the Dreamer, as he is called. This Indian, I have learned, has been for a long time disaffected. He has always denied and opposed the authority of the Government and their right to the lands now occupied by white settlers, ceded by treaty and acknowledged by the greater portion of his tribe as belonging to the United States. For some months he had separated himself from the Umatilla Reservation, and in opposition to the feelings and expressed inclinations of the Indians collected there had taken with him a small band, object to occupy the Grande Ronde Valley to the exclusion of our settlers. The designs of this party culminated, as reported, in attacks endangering the lives and property of settlers in that valley. The other Indians killed were clearly in the interest of the Dreamer and under his influence. To have arrested a few of the leaders engaged in these hostile movements it was supposed would have broken up the band. The more summary punishment resulting from their resistance has, I have no doubt, accomplished the same end, and the more effectually. All the reports from the Grande Ronde Valley and the Umatilla Reservation, from Indians as well as whites, concur in the representation that order and quiet have been restored. The promptness with which the aggressions of this small band of Indians has been visited by our troops, and the immediate punishment served, has, I think, produced a salutary effect for their future good conduct. It convinces them of the determination and ability of the Government to protect its citizens from outrage and enforce inviolate our stipulated relations.\n\nI am, very, respectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nJUSTUS STEINBERGER.\n\nColonel First Washington Territory Infantry, Commanding.\n\nASSISTANT ADJUTANT-GENERAL\n\nHeadquarters District of Oregon, Fort Vancouver, Wash. Ter."

          "text": "HEADQUARTERS COLUMN FROM CALIFORNIA,\nSanta Fe, N. Mex., September 20, 1862.\n\nCOLONEL; I wrote to you on July 22, informing you of all the important events connected with the Column from California from June 18 to that date. I then inclosed copies of General Orders, Nos. 10 and 11, from these headquarters, which prescribed the mannher in which the column should march across the desert from Tucson to the Rio Grande. I left Tucson myself on July 23; passed Colonel West, with most of the troops encamped on the San Pedro, on the 24th, and led the advance of the column from that point to Las Cruces, N. Mex., with one company of infantry and two of cavalry. From the hostile attitude of the Chiricahua Indians, I found it indispensably necessary to establish a post in what is known as Apache Pass. It is known as Fort Bowie, and garrisoned by 100 rank and file of the Fifth California Volunteer Infantry, and 13 rank and file of Company A, First California Volunteer Cavalry. This post commands the water in that pass. Around this water the Indians have been in the habit of lying in ambush and shooting troops and travelers as they came to drink. In this way they killed 3 of Lieutenant Colonel Eyre's command, and in attempting to keep Captain Roberts' First California Volunteer Infantry away from the spring a fight ensued, in which Captain Roberts had 2 men killed and 2 wounded. Captain Roberts reports that the Indians lost 10 kiffair the men of Captain Roberts' company are reported as behaving with great gallantry. Two miles beyond Apache Pass I foudn the remains of nine white men who had been murdered by the Indians. They were a party traveling from the Pino Alto mines to California. One of them had been burned at the stake; we saw the charred bones and the burnt ends of the rope by which he had been tied. The remains of seven of these men were buried on that spot. From the Rio de Sauz to Ojo de la Vaca there was a great dearth of water. At the latter place I addressed a letter to General Canby, giving him all the elements going to make up the column, the object of its march, and the wishes of General Wright. A copy of that letter is herewith inclsoed, marked A. *\n\nHaving been informed that a large number of men, women, and children were in a destitute and starving condition at Pino Alto mines, forty-odd miles northeastward from the Ojo de la Vaca, I directed Colonel West to furnish them with some subsistence stores as a gratuity. (See letter of instructions to Colonel West, marked B, and Captain Shirland's report on the starving condition of these people, marked C.) I arrived on the Rio Grande on August 7 at a point three miles above Fort Thorn, and immediately communicated with General Canby by letter, marked D. On August 9 I passed the Rio Grande at the San Diego Crossing, eighteen miles below Fort Thorn. The river was still very high and very rapid, but the men stripped off their clothes and dragged the wagons through by main force; the baggage, subsistence stores, ammunition, &c., were crossed in two small, leaky boats. Atthis point we bilt a larger and better boat for the use of the detachments of the column still to come up. The head of the column arrived at Las Cruses on August 10. Here I found the advance guard, under Lieutenant-Colonel Eyre, First California Volunteers Cavalry, strengthened by four companies of the Fifth U. S. Infantry, which has been sent down from Fort CRaig. Two companies of regular cavalry had also been sent down to re-enforce Colonel Eyre; but these has been recalled and had started back to Fort Craig on August 9.\n\nUnfortunately Colonel Eyre had been forbidden by Colonel Chivington and Colonel Howe to proceed in the direction of Texas below Las Cruses; otherwise I believe he would have captured the whole of Steele's force of Confederate troops. (See his report* on this subject, marked E.) The energy, enterprise, and resources of Colonel Eyre, as exhibited in his rapid march from Tuscon to the Rio Grande; his crossing of that river, adn his unlooked-for presence directly upon the heels of the retreating rebels, cannot be too highly appreciated. He exhibited some of the finest qualities of a soldier, and had he not been fettered by order from higher authority than himself, he would, with out a doubt, have achieved advantages over the enemy creditable to himself and to the Column from California. But for his timely arrival on the Rio Grande, Las Cruses and Msilla would have both been laid in ashes by the enemy. Hampered as he was by orders, he nevertheless managed to hoist the Stars and Stripes upon Fort Thorn, Fort Fillmore, Mesilla, and Fort Bliss, in Texas. On August 11 General Canby wrote me a very handsome letter, in which he liberaly offered to furnish the column with all the supplies it might need, together with $30,000 subsistence funds. General Wright will be gratified to read it; it is marched F. It will be seen by that letter that the medical supplies and ordnance stores in the Department of New Mexico are so abundant as to preclude the necessity of any more of these stores being purchased or shipped in the Department of the Pacific for any of the troops east of Fort Yuma belonging to the Column from California. On Auguts 11 General canby sent to me another communication, in which he treats of the impracticability of an invasion of Texas from this direction, and in which he speaks of removing the regular troops from New Mexico and of receiving other re-enforcements from California, As the views it sets forth seem to be of great value, I submit it for the perusal of General Wright; it is marked G.\n\nOn August 12 General Canby wrote still another letter, in which he authorized me to use my own judgment in regard to the disposition of troops in Arizona and Southern New Mexico; it is marked H. My letter to General Canby, dated August 15, together with General Orders, Nos. 14 and 15, herewith inclosed will inform General Wright of the distribution of the troops along the Rio Grande. These communications are marked I. On August 16 I started with three companies of cavalry for Fort Bliss, in Texas. At the town of Franklin, opposite El Paso, I found a surgeon of the Confederate Army and twenty-five sick and disabled soldiers, whom I made prisoners of war by order of General canby. I also found that a large amount of hospital stores and quartermaster's property, which once had belonged to the United States, was in store-rooms connected with the custom-house at El Paso, in Mexico. These stores I managed to recover; there were twelve wagon loads of them. I sent them to the depot at Mesilla, which I had established. I then proceeded 100 miles farther down the valley of the Rio Grande into Texas. The object of my march was to restore confidence to the people. They had been taught by the Texans that we were coming among them as marauders and as robbers. When they found we treated them kindly and paid them a fair price for all the supplies we required their rejoiced to find, as the came under the old flag once, more, that they could now have protection and will be treated justly. The abhorrence they expressed for the Confederate troops and of the rebellion convinced me that their loyalty to the United States is now beyind question.\n\nOn August 22 the troops of the Column from California hoisted the Stars and Striped over Fort Quitman. This was done by Captain JohnC. Cremony, with his company (B. Second California Volunteers Cavalry). On the same day Captain Shirland, First California Volunteer Cavalry, was directed to proceed to Fort Davis, 140 miles still farther into Texas, and hoisted the national colors over that post. (See General Orders, Numbers 16, marked K.) How well Captain Shirland performed this duty and how gallantly he and his men behaved in a fight with the Indians will be seen by his report, a copy of which is herewith inclosed, marked L. Captain Roberts' company, which whipped the Indians in Apache Pass, is from Sacramento. Lieutenant-Colonel Eyre, who led my advance guard to the Rio Grande and hoisted the colors over Forts, Third, Fillmore, Bliss, and Mesilla, is from Sacramento, and so is Captain Shirland, who hoisted the Stars and Stripes 240 miles farther into the State of Texas, and also whipped the Indians in that neighborhood. This speaks nobly for the men from that city. I inclose a telegraphic communication from General Canby to the Adjutant-General of the Army, dated August 10, in which he requests that a regiment more of infantry and five companies of cavalry be sent into the Department of New Mxico from California, so as to relieve the regular troops now here it is marked M. On August 21 I was instructed to arrange the affairs of the District of Arizona so as to turn over that district to have officer next in rank to myself, and to hold myself in readines to repair to the headquarters Department of New Mexico. I also received Special Orders, Numbers 148, from the headquarters of that department, directing me to send and officer as bearer of dispatches to the commander of the Department of the Pacific. Copies of these documents are herewith inclosed, Marked N.\n\nOn September 2 I received Special Orders, Numbers 153 (marked O), directing me to relieve Brigadier-General Canby in the command of the Department of New Mexico. Previous to this order I had published General Orders, Numbers 17, which posted a company of infantry at Franklin, Tex., and another one at Hart's Mill, Tex. It is herewith inclosed, marked P. On September 1 I put the texan prisoners of was whom I found at Franklin on their parole, and sent them on their way to San Antonio, tex., Escorted by Company D, First California Volunteer Cavalry. (See my letter to the commanding officer of the Confederate forces, San Antonio, Tex., marked Q.) I then returned to Las Cruses, N. Mex., where I published General Orders, Numbers 20 (marked R), regulating the affairs of the District of Arizona and transferring the command of that district to Colonel Joseph R. West, First California Volunteers Infantry. (I still retain the command of the Column from California, and shall cause all the reports which you require in your letter to me, dated at San Francisco, May 30, to be sent to the headquarters Department of the Pacific, until I am otherwise ordered by competent authority.) I then proceeded to Santa Fe, arriving here on the 16th instant.\n\nGeneral Canby relinquished the command of the Department of New Mexico on the 18th instant. (See General Orders, Numbers 83, marched S.) I assumed command of the department on the same day. (See General Orders, Numbers 84, marked T.) Some additional changes have been made of the troops pertaining to the Column from California, which are indicated in a letter to Colonel West, dated September 8 (marked U), and in another dated September 9 (marked V); also two others, dated September 14 (marked W and X, respctively). I inclose for your information three communications (marked Y). * I also inclose a copy of an order directing Lieutenant Colonel Edward E. Eyre, First California Volunteer Cavalry, to bear these dispatches to the headquarters Department of the pacific; it is marked us communications will give General Wright a pretty good idea of the operations of the troops composing the Column from California from July 22, of this year, to the present time.\n\nI find that the supply of provisions in this department is adequate to the wants of all the troops from California now serving here, and therefore respectfully recommend that no more subsistence stores be purchased for the Column from California until further advices on this subject. I propose to transport from Fort Yuma to Tucson during the cool weather of the fall and winter a large quantity of subsistence stores now in excess at the former post, so as to provide for the contingency of other troops being ordered to New Mexico from California; to provide for the troops already stationed in Arizona, and to form a magazine in case of any reverses here which may lead to the destruction of our present stores or oblige the California or other troops to retire toward the Pacific. When these supplies have been accumulated at Tuscon by a train now employed for that purpose that train will be required for service in this department; meantime it can be used as transportation from Fort Yuma to the Rio Grande for any troops which General Wright may order from the Department of the pacific into Arizona or New Mexico.\n\nThe Southern Overland Mail Route has been opened, and the military posts in Arizona, Southern New Mexico, and Northwestern Texas have been reoccupied by troops composing the Column from California. Thus far the instructions of the general commanding the Department of the Pacific have been carried out. It was no fault of the troops from California that the Confederate forces fled before them. It is but just to say that their having thus fled is mainly to be attributed to the gallantry of the troops under General Canby's command. That they were hurried in their flight by the timely arrival of the advance guard of the Column from California, under Lieutenant-Colonel Eyre, there cannot be a doubt. The march from the PAcific to the Rio Grande by the Column from California was not accomplished without immense toil and great hardships or without many privations and much suffering from heat and want of water. The amount of labor performed by Colonel Joseph R. West, the second in command, was immense and of the greatest practical importance,. Much of our success was dependent on his energy, perseverance, cheerfulness, and high soldierly qualities. I cannot too strongly recommend that this officer be promoted to the grade of brigadier-general of colunteers as a reward for these services, and particularly as he now commands the most important district in this department. I trust that General Wright will urge the necessity of this advancement of Colonel West, and set forth to the General-in-Chief his eminent fitness for the office of brigadier-General. This will promote Lieutenant-Colonel Rigg, which will be a reward for his important services as commanding officer at Fort Yuma during the past winter and for his efficient labors in the column while crossing the Great Desert. I regard Colonel Riggs as one of the finest, soldiers in the Columns from California. Thosewho knew the troops from Califnornia as I knew them will consider this a high compliment.\n\nLieutenant Colonel Edward E. Eyre, First California Volunteer Cavalry, deserves a regiment. The zeal he has manifested in the discharge of his duties and the alacrity and cheerfulness he has always shown when when called upon for any hazardous enterprise distinguished him as one eminently fitted for the profession of arms. If five companies more of cavalry are to be sent from California, as requested by General Canby, I trust they will be added to the five which now compose the First California Volunteer Cavalry, and that Lieutenant-Colonel Eyre will be commissioned as full colonel. The services of Major Coult, Fifth Califonia Volunteer Infantry, and of Major Fergusson, First California Volunteer Cavalry, and of Major McMullen, First Califonia Volunteer Infantry, have been most ardurous and are edeserving of reward. The officers and men of the Second Califonia Volunteer Cavalry and of the Fifth California Volunteer Infantry shared alike in all the privations and toil encountered by the First California Volunteer Infantry and the First California Volunteer Cavalry. As soldiers, patient, energetic, and patriotic. If I should select the names of some of them to be rewarded for these high qualities, it would be an invidious distinction. Captain John B. Shinn and First Lieutenant Franklin Hardwood, of the Third U. S. Artillery, for their incessant toil by night and by day to bring the battery of light artillery which is attached to the Column from california through the Yuma and Gila Deserts, should each receive the comliment of a brevet - Captain Shinn to be brevetted as major and First Lieutenant Hardwood as captain. Unless these young men are rewarded by a compliment of this kind I shall always feel that the passageof a battery of light artillery of light artillery, always in fighting condition, over such an inhospitable waste, in the midst of the heats of summer, is a matter of such trivial importance in the profession of arms as not to be worthy of notice. Theirs was the first battery that ever crossed the desesert. I am sure that he who crosses the next one will be considered an accomplished soldier. I trust that General Wright will call the attention of the General-in-Chief to the credit which is eminetly die these young gentleman for my adjutant-general, Lieutenant Benjamin C. Cutler; for my medical director, Surg. James M. McNulty, and for my regimental quartermaster, First Lieutenant La Fayette Hammond, all of the First California Volunteer Infantry. Their merits are too well known at the headquarters Departmentof the Pacific to need any further words of commendation from myself.\n\nIn conlusion, I beg to thank General Wright for the confidence he always reposed in me. In carrying out his orders and instructions I have endeavored to do my best, yet, as it was a new and very extended field of operations, my judgment about what was best to be done under emergencies as they arose was doubtless not always of the soundest character; yet I feel that General Wright has kindly overlooked all imperfections of this nature, and saved me the pain of many rebukes, which no doubt I have deserved. For this I feel very grateful. The march of the Column from California in the summer months across the Great Desert, in the driest season that has ever beed known for thirty years, is a military achievement creditable to the soldiers of the American Army; but it would not be just to attribute the success of this march to any ability on my part. That success was gained only by the high physical and moral enrgies of that peculiar class of officers and men who composed the Column from california. With any other troops I am sure I should have failed. I send you a set of colors which have been borne by this column. They were hoisted by Colonel West on Forts Vreckinridge and Buchanan, and over Tuscon, Ariz.,; by Colonel Eyer over Forts Thirn and Fillmore, and over Mesilla, N. Mex., and over Fort Bliss, in Texas. They were hoisted by Captain Cremory over Fort Quitman, and by Captain Shirland over Fort Davis, in Texas; and thus again have those places been consectrated to our beloved country.\n\nAll of which is respectfully submitted.\n\nJAMES H. CARLETON,\n\nBrigadier-General, U. S. Army, Commanding.\n\nLieutenant Colonel RICHARD C. DRUM,\n\nAsst. Adjt. General, U. S. Army, San Francisco, Cal."

Mex.:\n\nGENERAL: I wrote to you a letter from Ojo de la Vaca on the 2nd instant advising you of the strength of the forces under my command then en route to the Rio Grandle. Since then I have not received any letters from your headquarters advising me of the receipt of that communication. The inclosed general orders (Nos. 14 and 15, from these headquarters) will give you an idea of the force stationed at Mesilla. In Las Cruses there are four companies of the Fifth U. S. Infantry; at Fort Fillmore there are Shinn's light battery, Third U. S. Artillery; Companies A and E, First California Volunteer Infantry; Company B, Fifth California Volunteer Infantry, and Companies B and D, First California Volunteer Cavalry, and Company B, Second California Volunteer Cavalry. I places all the cavalry and nearly all the quartermaster's wagons and teams at Fort Fillmore on account of the good grazing in that vicinity and the abundance of mesquite beans now in tat neighborhood, which for the present precludes the necessity of purchasing much forage. As there are sufficient quarters at La Mesilla for the four companies of the Fifth U. S. Infantry I shall establish them in that town, unless otherwise directed by yourself, at least for the present. The emulation which will naturally spring up between them and the volunteers, as to who shall best perform their duties, will, in my opinion, be of great service to both; besides, there is a fine building there, where the supplies - quartermaster's and subsistence - can be kept free of expense, and the town of Mesilla is said to be a cooler and healthier locality than Las Cruses. Colonel Howe wrote to me desiring that I would send these four companies to Fort Craig, but this I do not feel authorized to do unless your order it. Mr. Woods the beef contractor, wrote me a note in relationto furnishing beef for my command. It is herewith inclosed,* together with my reply. I hope my desicion in this case will meet with your approval. I have not yet learned officially whether Mr. Woods will or not supply beef for only the four companies of regulars; I have heard that he would not. To-morrow I leave for Fort Bliss, in Texas, with Companies B, of the First, and B, of the Second, California Volunteer Cavalry. Company C, First California Volunteer Cavalry, is already at Hart's Mill, as you had doubtless heard previous to my arrival. There are many matters of moment which required my attention, as I have heard, in the neighorhood of Fort Bliss.\n\nI am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nJAMES H. CARLETON,\n\nBrigadier-General, Commanding."

          "text": "Report of Captain Medorem Crawford, U. S. Army, Assistant Quartermaster.\n\nPORTLAND, OREG., October 30, 1862.\n\nSIR: The duty of conducting an escort for the protection of emigrants to Oregon, &c., having been assigned me by the Secretary of War, and having performed that service, I deem it my duty, as it is the principal incidents of my trip.\n\nHaving organized my company, procured my transportation and provisions, I left Omaha, Nebr. Ter., on the 16th of June. My company consisted of fifty mounted men, armed with rifles and revolvers, who were instructed in the duties of sentinels and drilled in the simpler evolutions of cavalry tactics. Our route lay on the north side of and immediately along the Platte River, up the Sweetwater, over the Lander road to near Fort Hall, and from thence on the south side of Snake River to Walla Walla. The movement westward was very large. Emigrants to Oregon, Washington Territory, California, Salt Lake, and Denver were on this road. Some had started in April, and were consequently several hundred miles in advance of the rear portion of the emigration. Feeling it to be my duty to protect the rear, I did not hasten on the first part of the trip, but urged upon the emigrants whom I fell in with as I proceeded the necessity of husbanding the strength of their teams so as to be able to perform the journey over the barren deserts of Snake River, the necessity for which my last year's experience had taught me. I soon found that a large proportion of the emigrants had started for the Salmon River mines under the very erroneous impression as to the locality of them. A guide of the representing those mines as being within 180 miles of Fort Hall, not giving the locality of the road, but saying-good grass and plenty of water all the way. Under this impression many emigrants had overloaded their wagons and taxed their teams beyond their strength, and so positive were they that they could reach the mines without going down Snake River that many of them disregarded my counsel to dispense with comparatively useless articles with which they were encumbered. The result was that as soon as we left, the Platte Valley and encountered the heavy sand and hills their teams and wagons began to fail. They then found it necessary to do what I had advised long before, dispense with heavy and useless articles, but unfortunately it was too late to save many of their teams. From this point to Powder River article after article of furniture and wagon after wagon were left along, and scarcely a camp was left without some evidence of property abandoned. The large number of teams which were ahead of us had cut up the road to such an extent that the dust was very deep and its alkaline properties fatal to cattle. There were over forty head of dead cattle between the Owyhee and Malheur Rivers, a distance of sixteen miles, and we found the proportion nearly as great at other we saw was a grave at the crossing of New Fork of Green River. From the inscription placed over it we learned that Patrick Moran, of Missouri, was killed by Indians on the 18th of July and two men wounded. We passed this place August 11, about three weeks after, at which time no Indians were to be seen. The next grave was on La Barge Creek, in the Bear River Mountains, on the head-board of which was the following:\n\nOpened by Kavanaugh's train on the 27th of July, 1862. The body of a man found too badly decayed for removal. One shot in the temple and an arrow shot. Supposed to have been killed by Indians.\n\nOn the 25th day of August we passed the graves of the following persons; One unknown man found by Captain Glenn's party August 13. He had been shot in the back of the head with buckshot. Three miles farther there were five graves, side by side, of persons supposed to have been killed by Indians, Rufus C. Mitchell, N. Howie, James Steel, David Whitmer, and Frank Sessions were the names inscribed over them. This was in the vicinity of Fort Hall, and happened on the 9th of August, we passing on the 25th. We learned from the ferry-man that while these five men were slain by the Indians twenty armed men from the same train stood upon a hill near by and made no attempt to rescue their comrades. There are strong reasons for believing that white men bore a part in this massacre. Between Fort Hall and Raft River we foun four graves of men supposed to have been killed by Indians on the 9th of August. After crossing Raft River we found the grave of a Miss Adams, who was shot on the 9th and died on the 12th. We passed here August 31, twenty-two days after the fight. About the same time a Mr. Phillips left his train to go fishing, alone and unarmed and was taken by Indians, and is supposed to have been killed. This happened near Goose Creek. It will be seen that the number killed, of which we have positive information, is about fifteen. No emigrants have at any time been troubled by Indians while in the vicinity of my company, but from the disposition shown toward the advance parties it is easy to see that the later and weaker parties would have been easily cut off had it not been for the protection afforded them by the Government. Near old Fort Hall a ferry had been established and many emigrants had crossed in pursuit of the mines. Some went to Fort Lemhi, others to the Deer Lodge Prairie, while others kept down the north side of Snake River and recrossed the stream at Boise. From what was told me I am satisfied that many were induced to cross at Fort Hall by the representations of these ferrymen, which turned out unreliable. About twenty wagons which had crossed and met a returning party, were induced to recross and join those who were already under my escort. At this point I had 125 wagons of emigrants under my charge, and I found many of their teams so weak that they could not travel over ten miles per day, others being able to proceed faster; and in order to give protection to all, I divided my company, placing the advance party in charge of my principal assistant, Mr. Le Roy Crawford, while I remained with the rear and weaker party. From this point my journey was extremely slow. Many of the emigrants were short of provisions, which deficiency I had to supply. Others had difficulties among themselves which I was obliged to settle. The grass was very scarce, and their stock would scatter during the night, so that frequently my men would spend hours in looking after them in the morning. We curred their sick, fed their destitute, hunted, and in some instances drove their teams, mended their waeir goods, settled their disputes, and kept them moving. Two men died and one was drowned in Snake River. With these exceptions every man, woman, and child that had traveled in my vicinity reached the settlements in safety. From the best information in my possession I estimate the emigration to Oregon and Washington this year at 10,000 souls, about two-fifths of whom I think crossed Snake River at the Fort Hall Ferry. From my own observation I am satisfied that a better road for emigrants may be found on the north side of Snake River than the one on the south side, but the precise point at which that river should be crossed I am not prepared to decide. I know there is a good road from near Salomon Falls to Boise, having traveled down on that route in the year 1842, but as to the character of the country above that point on the north side, I have no reliable information. The recent discoveries of gold aon Boise River will doubtless attract large parties from the States next season, and a road on the north side will be very necessary. Should such be the case, and large numbers of emigrants with families flock to that country I fear that unless some protection is furnished by the Government the Indians will make an indiscriminate slaughter.\n\nI have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nMEDOREM CRAWFORD.\n\nCaptain and Assistant Quartermaster.\n\nBrigadier-General ALVORD,\n\nU. S. Army."

It was a long march for some of the troops, more than 1,000 miles. It was free from all untoward events, and the privations of the journey were cheerfully endured with soldierly fortitude and alacrity. No one doubts that if the opporutnity had offered the gallant troops under your command would have been distinguished in the face of the enemy. Let them not imagine that the people of this frontier do not appreciate the services your expedition rendered by displaying to the Indians in so many localities the power of the Government. The soldiers of an Oregon regiment have at all events had the satisfaction of seeing in the summer and fall of 1862 and 1863 systematic steps taken for the first time for the protection of the overland emigration. The people of Oregon as well as myself are no doubt ready to express their high appreciation of the honorable manner in which the First Oregon Cavalry have discharged the duties thus devolved upon them.\n\nI am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nBENJ.

          "text": "HDQRS. NORTHERN DIVISION, HUMBOLDT, MIL. DIST.\n\nFort Gaston, September 13, 1862\n\nLIEUTENANT: I have the honor to inclose for the information of the colonel commanding copies of the official reports of scouts made by the detachments under command of Captain Theller* and Lieutenant Noyes, in pursuance of Special Orders, Numbers 3, issued from these headquarters on the 5th instant; also official report of a scout by a detachment under Sergeant Collins, of Company F, per order of Captain Douglas, who was in command of this post during my absence with Lieutenant Morton's detachment. These several reports will, I trust, serve to convince the colonel commanding that the various parties zealously and perseveringly endeavored to accomplish the object of the movement, and that it was principally owing to the all but inaccessible nature of the region traversed that caused the plan to fail of success. From the information I had gathered in various ways, I was firm in the belief that the detachment I accompanied would encounter the band either at the source of Prosper Creek or at the heads of the Three Creeks, and in order to give no notice of our approach I moved in the most cautious manner, principally by night, avoiding all trails and overcoming obstacles in the way of frightfully steep ascents and descents, and all but impervious thickets and forests, presenting difficulties to progress of which no pen can give a just idea. Thoroughly examining the supposed localities of the ranches, we discovered but one which seemed to have rencently been occupied. This was situated near the banks of a small branch and in the midst of the brush. After a most careful scouting we could discover no traces of which course the Indians took in leaving this ranch. The report of Lieutenant Morton gives all further particulars of the party I accompanied. Captain Theller was equally unsuccessful, and after vainly waiting a c the arrival at the rendezvous of Lieutenant Noyes, our two detachments (our provisional and animals nearly exhausted) returned by different routes to this post, carefully searching, but without success, for Indian signs. At the post I received the most unwelcome intelligence of the disaster that had befallen the party under Lieutenant Noyes. His report and that of the party who afterward proceeded to the scene of the attack serves to give a correct idea of the perilous position of the detachment and the utter impossibility of forcing the Indians from their strong intrenchments, short of sacrificing the greater portion of the command in the attempt to scale the height on which the enemy was posted. I say uselessly, because if some few had succeeded in reaching the summit the nature of the ground upon the other side was such that the savages could have at once eluded pursuit in the dense brush of the ravine. There was no possible way of turning the position, and nothing was left but to retire to the timber a few hundred yards distant, which was done coolly, the men trning and firing whenever a glimpse of the Indians could be caught, Lieutenant Noyes being the last to entire the cover. These facts I gathered at different times from several men of the detachment, and after a thorough investigation of the whole matter I have the pleasure of reporting to the colonel commanding that, however mortifying the result, I am entirely convinced that no censure can be attached to the lieutenant commanding, but that he behaved in a cool, judicious manner throughout the whole affair, and deserves credit for extricating his command from such a well-devised ambuscade. It was a little less than miraculous that the whole party was not exterminated. It is most unfortunate that the messenger dispatched to inform me of the state of affairs failed to discover my whereabouts in the wilderness as possibly I should have been able to have come upon this band unexpectedly immediately after the fight, and when they hardly would have anticipated the approach of another party from a different quarter. If, as I had the honor of suggesting to the colonel commanding, Captain Flynn scouted at the head of Pilot Creek, there is a possibility that he may have fallen upon a portion of this band, which, according to the report of Sergeant Collins, probably took that direction. I shall have the honor in a few days of communicating personally with the colonel commanding, when I shall be able more fully and clearly to explain my ideas as to the future movements against this band of Indians, and give my reasons why I consider it judicious to delay for a time any expeditions against them.\n\nVery respectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nJAS. N. OLNEY.\n\nLieutenant-Colonel Second California, Volunteer Infantry, Commanding\n\nLieutenant JOHN HANNA,\n\nFirst Lieut, and Adjt. Second California Vol. Infty.,\n\nActg. Asst. Adjt.

TER., December 2, 1862.\n\nLIEUTENANT; I have the honor to report that on the afternoon of the 21st ultimo one of the herders belonging to this post, who was some thirty-five miles down the valley, came in and reported that 10 horses, 1 mule, and 1 head of beef had been stolen by the Indians the night before. I immediately telegraphed the fact to you. On the morning of the 22nd I started with a party, consisting of Captain Potts and forty-two men of Company F, Third Infantry California Volunteers, with six days' rations, for the purpose of recovering the stock and punishing the guilty parties. We left this post at 10 on the morning of the 22d, and after marching thirty miles encamped at 9 p. m. On the morning of the 23rd we started at sunrise, and after marching thirty miles over a rough, swampy road, where we had to make bridges, &c., for our wagon, we encamped for the night about sudown. On the morning of the 24th, finding it impossible to proceed farther with the wagon, Captain Potts and myself, withthree men (mounted), went ahead, leaving the command under Sergeant Buxton to folow on as fast as possible, leaving eight men as a guard to the wagon. I made a reconnaissance of the whole valley north to the mountains and finding no pass through the mountains, nor signs of either stock or Indians returned and met the command about twenty-five miles from our morning camp. The men suffering very much from fatigue and cold, and our rations being nearly exhausted, I deemed it advisable to return to the fort, where we arrived on the afternoon of the 27th. From my personal observations I am satisfied that there are no Indians in this valey north of this fort, and those that stole the stock came from Thousand Spring Valley, or that vicinity, probably belonging to the Bannock tribe. In conclusion, I would say that the men who were with me have done nobly, having marched a distance of 170 miles in less than five days (myself and Captain Potts and the three men with us some thirty miles farther), with weather intensely cold, and they thinly clad, without a murmur. I must say I am proud of them.\n\nVery respectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nP. A. GALLAGHER,\n\nMajor Third Infantry California Volunteers, Commanding post.\n\nLieutenant THOMAS S. HARRIS,\n\nActing Assistant Adjutant-General, District of Utah."

          "text": "SAN PEDRO STATION, July 22, 1862.\n\nSIR: I have the honor to inform you of my arrival at this post at 3 a. m. of this date in charge of the train which accompanied the command of Captain Roberts, First Infantry California Volunteers. The accompanying report* of that officer will explain the route over which we passed in going from Tucson, and the severe conflict had with the savages in Apache Pass, together with such other points of information as Captain Roberts may have possessed. Being fully impressed with the danger of attempting to take the train back through Apache Pass with my small command of thirty-nine men in the face of the fact that the Indians had not hesitated to attack and fight for six hours a command of 130, and knowing the value of the train, I returned by the road made by Captain (now General) Charles P. Stone. This route is about ten miles longer than the one leading to Dragoon Spring and through Apache Pass; but in all other respects it is so greatly superior that I am surprised the other should ever have been used. The first day I marched about thirty-three miles over a perfectly smooth and open country, with excellent road, and camped at a spot bearing north by west from the highest nubble on the Chiricahua Range, and where a side road puts out from the main one toward the above-mentioned range, leading to a fine green-looking canon three miles distance from the main road, and which is reported to yield abundance of water; but my limited command, the broken-down condition of my horses, and the absence of any commissioned officer with whom to leave the train, as well as the fact that I was supplied with waterfrom the tanks, induced me to refrain from exploring the canon, especially after the savages me to refrain from exploring the canon, especially after the savages inhabiting the range had given us so decided an example of their hostility. From the point above mentioned the road gradually circles the foothills over a fine open, rolling prairie, and from the extreme northern point of the foothills beares about west-southwest toward the two springs, where there is abundance of water and the best of pasture, distant from first camping place about twenty-four miles. From the twp springs the road first runs wet-southwest, until the foothills of the range in which Dragoon Spring is located are passed, when it trends nearly south for several miles, thence southwest until it meets the other road about fifteen miles beyond San Pedro Station, from which the two springs are about thirty-two miles distant. The whole of this route is over a clear open country, and the road excellent as well as the pasture. On the other road the grass at the cienega is coarse, rank sacaton, void of any nourishment; the same at the San Pedro' no grass at Dragoon Spring; none at the camp-ground, or near it, at Apache Pass, and but little and quite dry as well as infeerior at San Simon. As Captain Roberts marched by day and the horses were obliged for safeto to be tied to the picket-rope at night, and were entirely without grain, and almost altogether without grass, they are almost too weak to stand up, and I sincerely beg that the general would relieve me from road duty. I forwarded the dispatches and mail from San Simon by express. I am really so worn out and haggard that I beg you to excuse a more minute detail at this time.\n\nRespectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nJOHN C. CREMORY,\n\nCaptain, Second Cavalry California Volunteers.\n\nLieutenant BENJAMIN C. CUTLER,\n\nFirst Infantry California Volunteers, Actg. Asst. Adjt. General"

The general commanding directs that you send for this purpose Lieutenant Colonel Edwin A. Rigg, First California Volunteer Infantry, with about 200 rank and file, so selected as not to take from your command more than three companies. Captain Fritz, First California Volunteer Cavalry, will proceed to Tucson, as previously directed, with twenty-five wagons. If Wagon-Master Veck has not already started for Peralta with fifteen wagons, as directed, the general commanding orders that his train be increased to thirty-five wagons. If he has already started, send twenty additional wagons when Colonel Rigg goes to Fort Craig. Wagon-Master Francis will go with Captain Fritz to Tucson, and Winston will remain with the rest of the wagons.\n\nI am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nBEN. C.

CARLETON,\n\nCommanding Column from California, District of Arizona:\n\nGENERAL: I have just received your communication of the 8th instant. It is my wish that you should exercise your own judgment both with regard to the distribution of your troops and the point at which your headquarters will be established. My instructions to Colonel Chivington of June 22 and subsequent dates were predicated upon the supposition that he would meet with some resistance, and were more in detail than I should have considered necessary with an officer of more experience. In my letter of yesterday I gave the general tenor of my instructions, in order thatyou might use your discretion in carrying out the policy of the Government with reference to this department. Directions will be given to send tents to Fort Craig for the use of your command, and I trust that you will not hesitate in askingfor anything that will add to the comfort of your command. If not already at Fort Craig, it will be sent there, and if not now in abundance, we will share wat we havem and renew our supplies when the trains come in. It will probably be necessary for a time to send your own transportation to Fort Craig for any supplies that you may need from that place.\n\nVery respectfully, sir, your obedient servant,\n\nED. R. S. CANBY,\n\nBrigadier-General, Commanding Department."

CARLETON,\n\nCommanding Column from California, District of Arizona:\n\nGENERAL: At an early period of last year I reported that an invasion of Texas from new mexico, although practicable, was not a practicable undertaking; the length of the march, the desert character of the country to be traversed, the scarcity of supplies on the route, the necessity of bringing from the Missouri River or from the Pacific coast every article of equipment and munition and much of the food, all cinspired to make it an undertaking of great magnitude and of questionable value; and that the troops that would be required for the expedition could be more usefully employed at points that are not only near the appeared of supply but near the points to be attacked. The same views appeared to have been entertained at the Headquarters of the Army, as before my report could have reached Washington I received instructions to withdraw first a part and afterward the whole of the regular force then in New Mexico. These last instructions were subsequently so modified as to direct the withdrawal of these troops \"as such time and in such manner as would not expose the Territory to consequent or invasion before the volunteer troops of New Mexico are property organized, armed, and posted. \" At a later period I reported that it would be difficult, if not impracticable, to raise the additional force authorized for this Territory; nor do I think it desarable that it should be done if it is practicable to send one or two volunteer regiments from the East to replace the regular troops when they are withdrawn. The New Mexican Volunteers, unless supported by regular troops or by volunteers drawn from some other section of the country, cannot be relied on to resist invasion of the this department I received instructions from the Secretary of War to disband the New Mexican Voluntthought proper. The force from the Department of the Mississippi was subsequently diverted from its destination, and soon after information was receievd that your command was on the march. I have coupled these changes with the instructions for the movement of the regular troops, and supposed that your command was intended for service in New Mexico.\n\nActing upon this supposition, I have reported that \"the near approach of General Carleton's force justifies the opinion that the regular troops may now be withdrawn, as originally intended, without detriment to the service,\" and have already made some arrangements for the movement; but as there have been some material changes since these instructions were given, I do not intend to put any of the regular troops beyond the reach of recall until I receive further instructions. I have been thus particular, not only for the purpose of answering your question, but to particular, not only for the purpose of answering your question, but to indicate the policy and instructions under which I have been acting, and which I suppose will devolve upon when the regular troops leave the country. In the arrangements that were made made for the reoccupation of Arizona it was my intention to restore the sovereignty of the United States in its original integrity, post the troops os as to protect the inhabitants and guard against invasion, and, in addition, to occupy such points in Texas as could be reached without throwing the troops so employed the reach of support. This has been directed in general terms in the instructions given to the commander of the Southern Military District, and who would also have been the commander of the expdition organized for that purpose. Copies of these instructions have laready been furnished you. The retreat of the rebels and the approach of your command rendered it unnecessary to send this force below the Jornada, and, with the exception of the infantry e cavalry force with Lieutenant-Colonel Eyre, it has been recalled. The detachments will also be recalled, but the movement will not be commenced until your arrangements are so far perfected that it can be done without incovenience.\n\nI do not think that an invasion of New Mexico will again be attempted by the Rio Grande; but if our troops in the Southwest should meet with any serious reserves, it may be by the Canadian or attempts may be made to interrupt our communications with the East. This last I have regarded as the most probable danger, and some time since requested the commander of the Department of Kansas to place a sufficient force on that line (within his department) to secure it. The renewal of the disturbances in Missourihas prevented this, and I am now putting some of the Colorado troops on the line. If there should be no change in the order for the removal of theregular troops a part of your command will probably be needed at and above Fort Craig. I have estimated the force required at that post and the Rio Grande as far as Fort Bliss at 2,000 men. I infer from your letter of May 3 that you can readily be re-enforced from California, and there is no doubt that troops can better be spared from ythat State than from any other quarter. I make these suggestions now for your consideration, and will be pleased to hear from you in relation to them before any general movement of the regular troops takes place.\n\nVery respectfully, sir, your obedient servant,\n\nED. R. S. CANBY,\n\nBrigadier-General, Commanding Department."
